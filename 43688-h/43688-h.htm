<p class="center"><i>A Tale of the South Pacific.</i></p>

<h2><a name="chI" id="chI"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="h3">WE SIGHT A BOAT.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the eighteenth day out from Sydney, we
were cruising under the lee of Erromanga&mdash;of
course you know Erromanga, an
isolated island between the New Hebrides and
the Loyalty group&mdash;when suddenly our dusky
Polynesian boy, Nassaline, who was at the masthead
on the lookout, gave a surprised cry of
&quot;Boat ahoy!&quot; and pointed with his skinny black
finger to a dark dot away southward on the
horizon, in the direction of Fiji.</p>

<p class="indent">I strained my eyes and saw&mdash;well, a barrel
or something. For myself, I should never have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
made out it was a boat at all, being somewhat
slow of vision at great distances; but, bless
your heart! these Kanaka lads have eyes like
hawks for pouncing down upon a canoe or a
sail no bigger than a speck afar off; so when
Nassaline called out confidently, &quot;Boat ahoy!&quot;
in his broken English, I took out my binocular,
and focused it full on the spot towards which
the skinny black finger pointed. Probably,
thought I to myself, a party of natives, painted
red, on the war-trail against their enemies in
some neighboring island; or perhaps a &quot;labor
vessel,&quot; doing a veiled slave-trade in &quot;indentured
apprentices&quot; for New Caledonia or the
Queensland planters.</p>

<p class="indent">To my great surprise, however, I found out,
when I got my glasses fixed full upon it, it
was neither of these, but an open English row-boat,
apparently, making signs of distress, and
alone in the midst of the wide Pacific.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, mind you, one doesn&#39;t expect to find
open English row-boats many miles from land,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
drifting about casually in those far-eastern
waters. There&#39;s very little European shipping
there of any sort, I can tell you; a man may
sometimes sail for days together across that
trackless sea without so much as speaking a
single vessel, and the few he does come across
are mostly engaged in what they euphoniously
call &quot;the labor-trade&quot;&mdash;in plain English, kidnaping
blacks or browns, who are induced to
sign indentures for so many years&#39; service (generally
&quot;three yams,&quot; that is to say, for three
yam crops), and are then carried off by force or
fraud to some other island, to be used as laborers
in the cane-fields or cocoa-nut groves. So
I rubbed my eyes when I saw an open boat, of
European build, tossing about on the open, and
sang out to the man at the wheel:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hard a starboard, Tom! Put her head
about for the dark spot to the sou&#39;-by-southeast
there!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Starboard it is!&quot; Tom Blake answered
cheerily, setting the rudder about; and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
headed straight for that mysterious little craft
away off on the horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">But there! I see I&#39;ve got ahead of my story,
to start with, as the way is always with us salt-water
sailors. We seafaring men can never
spin a yarn, turned straight off the reel all
right from the beginning, like some of those
book-making chaps can do. We have always
to luff round again, and start anew on a fresh
tack half a dozen times over, before we can get
well under way for the port we&#39;re aiming at.
So I shall have to go back myself to Sydney
once more, to explain who we were, and how
we happened to be cruising about on the loose
that morning off Erromanga.</p>

<p class="indent">My name, if I may venture to introduce myself
formally, is Julian Braithwaite. I am the
owner and commander of the steam-yacht
<i>Albatross</i>, thirty-nine tons burden, as neat a
little craft as any on the Pacific, though it&#39;s me
that says it as oughtn&#39;t to say it; and I&#39;ve
spent the last five years of my life in cruising in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
and out among those beautiful archipelagos in
search of health, which nature denies me in
more northern latitudes. The oddest part of it
is, though I&#39;m what the doctors call consumptive
in England&mdash;only fit to lie on a sofa and
read good books&mdash;the moment I get clear away
into the Tropics I&#39;m a strong man again, prepared
to fight any fellow of my own age and
weight, and as fit for seamanship as the best
Jack Tar in my whole equipment. The <i>Albatross</i>
numbers eighteen in crew, all told; and as
I am not a rich enough or selfish enough a man
to keep up a vessel all for my own amusement,
my brother Jim and I combine business and
pleasure by doing a mixed trade in copra or
dried cocoa-nut with the natives from time to
time, or by running across between Sydney and
San Francisco with a light cargo of goods for
the Australian market.</p>

<p class="indent">Our habit was therefore to cruise in and out
among the islands, with no very definite aim
except that of picking up a stray trade whenever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
we could make one, and keeping as much
within sight of land, for the sake of company, as
circumstances permitted us. And that is just
why, though bound for Fiji, we had gone so far
out of our way that particular voyage as to be
under the lee of Erromanga.</p>

<p class="indent">As for our black Polynesian boy, Nassaline,
to tell you the truth, I am proud of that lad, for
he&#39;s a trophy of war; we got him at the point
of the sword off a slaver. She was a fast
French sloop, &quot;recruiting&quot; for New Caledonia,
as they call it, on one of the New Hebrides,
when the <i>Albatross</i> happened to come to anchor,
by good luck or good management, in the same
harbor. From the moment we arrived I had
my eye on that smart French sloop, for I more
than half suspected the means she was employing
to beat up recruits. Early next morning, as
I lay in my bunk, I heard a fearful row going
on in boats not far from our moorings; and
when I rushed up on deck, half-dressed, to find
out what the noise was about, blessed if I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
didn&#39;t see whole gangs of angry natives in
canoes, naked of course as the day they were
born, or only dressed, like the Ancient Britons,
in a neat coat of paint, pursuing the French
sloop&#39;s jolly-boat, which was being rowed at
high pressure by all its crew toward its own vessel.
&quot;Great guns!&quot; said I, &quot;what&#39;s up?&quot; So,
looking closer, I could make out four strapping
young black boys lying manacled in the bottom,
kicking and screaming as hard as their legs and
throats could go, while the Frenchmen rowed
away for dear life, and the Kanakas in the
canoes paddled wildly after them, taking cock-shots
at them with very bad aim from time to
time with arrows and fire-arms. Such a splutter
and noise you never heard in all your life.
Ducks fighting in a pond were a mere circumstance
to it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tom Blake!&quot; I sang out, &quot;is the gig afloat
there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye, aye, sir,&quot; says Tom, jumping up. &quot;She&#39;s
ready at the starn. Shall we off and at &#39;em?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
&quot;Right you are, Tom!&quot; says I; &quot;all hands
to the gig here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Well, in less than three minutes I&#39;d got that
boat under way, and was rowing ahead between
the Frenchmen and their sloop, with our Remingtons
ready, and everything in order for a
good stand-up fight of it.</p>

<p class="indent">When the Frenchmen saw we meant to intercept
them, and found themselves cut off between
the savages on one side and an English crew
well-armed with rifles of precision on the other,
they thought it was about time to open negotiations
with the opposing party. So the skipper
stopped, as airy as a gentleman walking down
the Boulevards, and called out to me in French,
&quot;What do you want ahoy, there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ahoy there yourself,&quot; says I, in my very
best Ollandorff. &quot;We want to know what
you&#39;re doing with those youngsters?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! it&#39;s that, is it?&quot; says the Frenchman,
as cool as a cucumber, coming nearer a bit, and
talking as though we&#39;d merely stopped him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
polite inquiries about the time of day or the
price of spring chickens; while the savages,
seeing from our manner we were friendly to
their side, left off firing for a while for fear of
hitting us. &quot;Why, these are apprentices of
ours&mdash;indentured apprentices. We&#39;ve bought
them from their parents by honest trade&mdash;paid
for &#39;em with Sniders, ammunition, calico and
tobacco; and if you want to see our papers and
theirs, Monsieur, here they are, look you, all
perfectly <i>en règle</i>,&quot; and he held up the bundle for
us to inspect in full&mdash;with a telescope, I suppose&mdash;at
a hundred yards&#39; distance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Row nearer, boys,&quot; I said, &quot;and we&#39;ll talk
a bit with this polite gentleman. He seems to
have views of his own, I fancy, about the proper
method of engaging servants.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But when we tried to row up the Frenchman
stopped and called out at the top of his voice,
in a very different tone, all bustle and bluster,
&quot;Look out ahead there! If you come a yard
closer we open fire. We want no interference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
from any of you Methodistical missionary
fellows.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We ain&#39;t missionaries,&quot; I answered quietly,
cocking my revolver in the friendliest possible
fashion right in front of him; &quot;we&#39;re traders
and yachtsmen. Show &#39;em your Remingtons,
boys, and let &#39;em see we mean business! That&#39;s
right. Ready! present!&mdash;and fire when I tell
you! Now then, Monsieur, you bought these
boys, you say. So far, good. Next then, if you
please, who did you buy them from?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Frenchman turned pale when he saw
we were well-armed and meant inquiry; but he
tried to carry off still with a little face and
bluster. &quot;Why, their parents, of course,&quot; he
answered, with a signal to his friends in the
ship to cover us with their fire-arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From their parents? O, yes! Well, how
did you know the sellers were their parents?&quot;
I asked, still pointing my revolver towards him.
&quot;And why are the boys so unwilling to go?
And what are the natives making such a noise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
over this little transaction in indentured labor
for? If it&#39;s all as you say, what&#39;s this fuss and
row about? Keep your rifles steady, lads.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They want to back out of their bargain, I
suppose, now they&#39;ve drunk our rum and
smoked our tobacco,&quot; the Frenchman said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No true, no true,&quot; one of the natives
shouted out from beyond in his broken English.
&quot;Man a <i>oui-oui</i>!&quot;&mdash;that&#39;s what they call the
French, you know, all through the South Pacific&mdash;&quot;man
a <i>oui-oui</i>, bad&mdash;no believe man, a <i>oui-oui</i>&mdash;him
make us drunk, so try to cheat us.&quot;</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you look here, Monsieur,&quot; I said
severely, turning to the skipper, &quot;I know what
you&#39;ve been doing. I&#39;ve seen this little game
tried on before. You landed here last night
with your peaceable equipment for recruiting
labor&mdash;we know what that means&mdash;a Winchester
sixteen-shooter and half a dozen pairs
of English handcuffs. You brought on shore
your &#39;trade&#39;&mdash;a common clay pipe or two,
some cheap red cloth, and a lot of bad French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
Government tobacco; and you treated the
natives all round to free drinks of your square
gin. When they&#39;d reached that state of convenient
conviviality that they didn&#39;t know who they
were or what they were doing, you took advantage
of their guileless condition. You picked
out the likeliest young men and lads, selected
any particularly drunken native lying about loose
to represent their fathers, made &#39;em put their
marks to a formal paper of indentures, and
handed over twenty dollars, a bottle of rum,
and a quid of tobacco, as a consolation for the
wounded feelings of their distressed relations.
You&#39;ve been carrying them off all night at your
devil&#39;s game; and now in the morning the
natives are beginning to wake up sober, miss
their friends, and put a summary stop to your
little proceedings. Well, sir, I give you one
minute to make up your mind; if you don&#39;t
hand us over these four lads to set on shore
again, we&#39;ll open fire upon you; and as we&#39;re
stronger than you, with the natives at our back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
we&#39;ll make a prize of you, and tow you into Fiji
on a charge of slave-trading.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before the words were well out of my mouth
the French skipper had given the word &quot;Fire!&quot;
and the bullets came whizzing past, and riddling
the gunwale of the gig beside us. One of them
grazed my arm below the shoulder and drew
blood. Now there&#39;s nothing to put a man&#39;s
temper up like getting shot in the arm. I lost
mine, I confess, and I shouted aloud, &quot;Fire,
boys, and row on at them!&quot; Our fellows fired,
and the very same moment the natives closed
in and went at them with their canoes, all alive
with Sniders, lances and hatchets. It was a
lively time, I can tell you, for the next five minutes,
with those lithe, long black fellows swarming
over them like ants; and poor Tom Blake
got a bullet from a French rifle in his thigh,
that lodges there still in very comfortable quarters.
But one of the Frenchmen fell back in
the jolly-boat shot through the breast, and the
skipper, who turned out to be a fellow with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
one sound leg and a substitute, was severely
wounded. So we&#39;d soon closed in upon them,
the natives and ourselves, and overpowered their
crew, which was only ten, all told, besides the
fellows on the big vessel in the harbor.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, we took out the four boys, when the
mill was over, and transferred them to our gig;
and then we escorted the Frenchmen, ironed in
their own handcuffs, to the deck of their sloop,
with the natives on either side in their canoes
rowing along abreast of us like a guard of
honor. The crew of the sloop didn&#39;t attempt
to interfere with us as we brought their comrades
handcuffed aboard; if they had, why,
then, with the help of the savages, we should
have been more than a match for them. So we
prowled around the ship on a voyage of discovery,
and found ample evidence in her get-up
of her character as an honest and single-hearted
recruiter of labor. A rack in the cabin held
eight Snider rifles, loaded for use, above which
hung eight revolvers, employed doubtless in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
self-defense against the lawless character of the
Kanakas, as the skipper (with his hands in irons
and his eyes in tears) most solemnly assured us.
The sloop was prepared throughout, with loopholes
and battening-hatches, to stand a siege,
and could have made short work of the natives
alone had they tried to attack her, for she
carried a small howitzer, not so big as our own;
but she never suspected interference from a
European vessel. We went down into her hold,
and there we found about forty natives, men,
women and children&mdash;free agents all, the
skipper had declared&mdash;packed as tight as herrings
in a barrel, and with stench intolerable to
the European nostril. Such a sight you never
saw in your life. There they lay athwart ship,
side by side, the unhappy black cattle, some
handcuffed and manacled, others dead-drunk
and too careless to complain, while the women
and children were crying and screaming, and
the men were shouting as loud as they could
shout in their own lingo.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
Fortunately, we had a sailor aboard the <i>Albatross</i>
who had been a beach-comber (or degraded
white man who lives like a native) for three
years on the island of Ambrymon, and had a
Kanaka girl for a sweetheart; so he could talk
their palaver almost as easy as you can English,
and he acted as interpreter for us with the poor
people in the hold. We knocked their handcuffs
off, and explained the situation to them.
About a dozen of the wretchedest and most
squalid-looking of the lot were prepared, even
when we offered them freedom, to stand by their
last night&#39;s bargain, and go on to New Caledonia;
but the remainder were only too delighted
to learn that they might go ashore again; and
they gave us three ringing British cheers as soon
as they understood we had really liberated them.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the four boys we&#39;d got in the gig, three
of them elected at once to go home to their own
people on the island; but the fourth was our
present black servant, Nassaline. He, poor
boy, was an orphan; and his nearest relations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
having held a consultation the day before whether
they should bake him and eat him, or sell him
to the Frenchman, had decided that after all he
would be worth more if paid for in tobacco and
rum than if roasted in plantain-leaves. So, as
soon as he found we were going to put him on
shore again, the poor creature was afraid after all
he was being returned for the oven; and flinging
himself on his face in the gig, groveling
and cringing, he took hold of our knees and besought
us most piteously (as our sailor translated
his words for us) to take him with us.
Of course, when we entered into the spirit of
the situation, we felt it was impossible to send
the poor fellow back to be made &quot;long pig&quot; of;
so, to his immense delight, we took him along,
and a more faithful servant no man ever had
than poor Nassaline proved from that day forth
to me.</p>

<p class="indent">I&#39;ve gone out of my way so far, as I said before,
to tell you this little episode of life in the
South Pacific, partly in order to let you know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
who Nassaline was and how we came by him;
but partly also to give you a side glimpse of the
sort of gentry, both European and native, one
may chance to knock up against in those remote
regions. It&#39;ll help you to understand the rest of
my yarn. And now, if you please, I&#39;ll tack back
again once more into my proper course, to the
spot where I broke off in sight of Erromanga.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chII" id="chII"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE BOAT&#39;S CREW.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Presently</span>, as we headed towards the
black object on the horizon, Nassaline
stretched out that skinny finger of his once
more (no amount of feeding ever seemed to
make Nassaline one ounce fatter), and cried out
in his shrill little piping voice, &quot;Two man on
the boat! him makey signs for call us!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I&#39;d give anything to have eyes as sharp as
those Polynesians. I looked across the sea,
and the loppy waves in the foreground, and
could just make out with the naked eye that
the row-boat had something that looked like a
red handkerchief tied to her bare mast, and a
white signal flapping in the wind below it; but
not a living soul could I distinguish in her without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
my binocular. So I put up my glasses and
looked again. Sure enough, there they were,
two miserable objects, clinging as it seemed
half-dead to the mast, and making most piteous
signs with their hands to attract our attention.
As soon as they saw that we had really sighted
them, and were altering our course to pick them
up, their joy and delight knew no bounds, as
we judged. They flung up their arms ecstatically
into the air, and then sank back, exhausted,
as I guessed, on to the thwarts where they had
long ceased sitting or rowing.</p>

<p class="indent">They were wearied out, I imagined, with long
buffeting against that angry and immeasurable
sea, and must soon have succumbed to fatigue
if we hadn&#39;t caught sight of them.</p>

<p class="indent">We put on all steam, as in duty bound, and
made towards them hastily. By and by, my
brother Jim, who had been off watch, came up
from below and joined me on deck to see what
was going forward. At the same moment Nassaline
cried out once more, &quot;Him no two man!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
Him two boy! Two English boy! Him hungry
like a dying!&quot; And as he spoke, he held
his own skinny bare arm up to his mouth dramatically,
and took a good bite at it, as if to indicate
in dumb show that the crew of the boat
were now almost ready to eat one another.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim looked through the glasses, and handed
them over to me in turn. &quot;By George, Julian,&quot;
he said, &quot;Nassaline&#39;s right. It&#39;s a couple of
boys, and to judge by the look of them, they&#39;re
not far off starving!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I seized the glasses and fixed them upon the
boat. We were getting nearer now, and could
make out the features of its occupants quite
distinctly. A more pitiable sight never met my
eyes. Her whole crew consisted of two white-faced
lads, apparently about twelve or thirteen
years old, dressed in loose blue cotton shirts
and European trousers, but horribly pinched
with hunger and thirst, and evidently so weak
as to be almost incapable of clinging to the bare
mast whence they were trying to signal us.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
Now, you land-loving folk can hardly realize,
I dare say, what such an incident means at sea;
but to Jim and me, who had sailed the lonely
Pacific together for five years at a stretch, that
pathetic sight was full both of horror and unspeakable
mystery. For anybody, even grown
men long used to the ocean, to be navigating that
awful expanse of water alone in an empty boat
is little short of ghastly. Just think what it
means! A stormy sheet that stretches from
the north pole to the south without one streak
of continuous land to break it; a stormy sheet
on which the winds and waves may buffet you
about in almost any direction for five thousand
miles, with only the stray chance of some remote
oceanic isle to drift upon, or some coral reef to
swallow you up with its gigantic breakers. But
a couple of boys!&mdash;mere children almost!&mdash;alone,
and starving, on that immense desert
of almost untraveled water! On the Atlantic
itself your chance of being picked up from open
boats by a passing vessel is slight enough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
heaven knows! but on the Pacific, where ships
are few and routes are far apart, your only
alternative to starvation or foundering is to find
yourself cast on the tender mercies of the cannibal
Kanaka. No wonder I looked at Jim,
and Jim looked at me, and each of us saw unaccustomed
tears standing half ashamed in the
eyes of the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop her!&quot; I cried. &quot;Lower the gig, Tom
Blake! Jim, we must go ourselves and fetch
these poor fellows.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the sound of my bell the engineer pulled
up the <i>Albatross</i> short and sharp, with admirable
precision, and we lowered our boat to go
out and meet them. As we drew nearer and
nearer with each stroke of our oars, I could see
still more plainly to what a terrible pitch of
destitution and distress these poor lads had
been subjected during their awful journey.
Their cheeks were sunken, and their eyes
seemed to stand back far in the hollow sockets.
Their pallid white hands hardly clung to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
mast by convulsive efforts with hooked fingers.
They had used up their last reserve of strength
in their wild efforts to attract our attention.</p>

<p class="indent">I thanked heaven it was Nassaline who kept
watch at the mast-head when they first hove in
sight. No European eye could ever have discovered
the meaning of that faint black speck
upon the horizon. If it hadn&#39;t been for the
sharp vision of our keen Polynesian friend,
these two helpless children might have drifted
on in their frail craft for ever, till they wasted
away with hunger and thirst under the broiling
eye of the hot Pacific noontide.</p>

<p class="indent">We pulled alongside, and lifted them into
the gig. As we reached them, both boys fell
back faint with fatigue and with the sudden
joy of their unexpected deliverance. &quot;Quick,
quick, Jim! your flask!&quot; I cried, for we had
brought out a little weak brandy and water on
purpose. &quot;Pour it slowly down their throats&mdash;not
too fast at first&mdash;just a drop at a time,
for fear of choking them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
Jim held the youngest boy&#39;s head on his lap,
and opened those parched lips of his that looked
as dry as a piece of battered old shoe-leather.
The tongue lolled out between the open teeth
like a thirsty dog&#39;s at midsummer, and was hard
and rough as a rasp with long weary watching.
We judged the lad at sight to be twelve years
old or thereabouts. Jim put the flask to his
lips, and let a few drops trickle slowly down his
burnt throat. At touch of the soft liquid the
boy&#39;s lips closed over the mouth of the flask
with a wild movement of delight, and he sucked
in eagerly, as you may see a child in arms suck
at the mouthpiece of its empty feeding-bottle.
&quot;That&#39;s well,&quot; I said. &quot;He&#39;s all right, at any
rate. As long as he has strength enough to
pull at the flask like that, we shall bring him
round in the end somehow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We took away the flask as soon as we thought
he&#39;d had as much as was good for him at the
time, and let his head fall back once more upon
Jim&#39;s kindly shoulder. Now that the first wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
flush of delight at their rescue was fairly over,
a reaction had set in; their nerves and muscles
gave way simultaneously, and the poor lad fell
back, half-fainting, half-sleeping, just where Jim
with his fatherly solicitude chose to lay him.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom Blake and I turned to the elder lad.
His was a harder and more desperate case.
Perhaps he had tried more eagerly to save his
helpless brother; perhaps the sense of responsibility
for another&#39;s life had weighed heavier
upon him at his age&mdash;for he looked fourteen;
but at any rate he was well-nigh dead with exposure
and exhaustion. The first few drops we
poured down his throat he was clearly quite unable
to swallow. They gurgled back insensibly.
Tom Blake took out his handkerchief, and
tearing off a strip, soaked it in brandy and
water in the cup end of the flask; then he
gently moistened the inside of the poor lad&#39;s
mouth and throat with it, till at last a faint
swallowing motion was set up in the gullet.
At that, we poured down some five drops cautiously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
To our delight and relief they were
slowly gulped down, and the poor white mouth
stood agape like a young bird&#39;s in mute appeal
for more water&mdash;more water.</p>

<p class="indent">We gave him as much as we dared in his existing
state, and then turned to the boat for
some clue to the mystery.</p>

<p class="indent">She was an English-built row-boat, smart and
taut, fit for facing rough seas, and carrying a
short, stout mast amidships. On her stern we
found her name in somewhat rudely-painted
letters, <i>Messenger of Peace: Makilolo in Tanaki</i>.
Clearly she had been designed for mission service
among the islands, and the last words which
followed her title must be meant to designate
her port, or the mission station. But what that
place was I hadn&#39;t a notion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where&#39;s Tanaki, Tom Blake?&quot; I asked,
turning round, for Tom had been navigating the
South Seas any time this twenty years, and
knew almost every nook and corner of the wide
Pacific, from Yokohama to Valparaiso.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
Tom shifted his quid from one cheek to the
other and answered, after a pause, &quot;Dunno, sir,
I&#39;m sure. Never heerd tell of Tanaki in all my
born days; an&#39; yet I sorter fancied, too, I
knowed the islands.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are no signs of blood or fighting in
the boat,&quot; I said, examining it close. &quot;They
can&#39;t have escaped from a massacre, anyhow.&quot;
For I remembered at once to what perils the
missionaries are often exposed in these remote
islands&mdash;how good Bishop Patteson had been
murdered at Santa Cruz, and how the natives
had broken the heads of Mason and Wood at
Erromanga not so many months back, in cold
blood, out of pure lust of slaughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they must have run away in an awful
hurry,&quot; Tom Blake added, overhauling the
locker of the boat, &quot;for, see, she ain&#39;t found;
there ain&#39;t no signs of food or anything to hold
it nowheres, sir; and this ere little can must &#39;a&#39;
been the o&#39;ny thing they had with &#39;em for water.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was quite right. The boat had clearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
put to sea unprovisioned. It deepened our
horror at the poor lads&#39; plight to think of this
further aggravation of their incredible sufferings.
For days they must have tossed in hunger
and thirst on the great deep. But we could
only wait to have the mystery cleared up when
the lads were well enough to explain to us what
had happened. Meanwhile we could but look
and wonder in silence; and indeed we had quite
enough to do for the present in endeavoring to
restore them to a state of consciousness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any marks on their clothes?&quot; my brother
Jim suggested, with practical good sense, looking
up from his charge as we rowed back toward
the <i>Albatross</i>, with the <i>Messenger of Peace</i> in tow
behind us. &quot;That might help us to guess who
they are, and where they hail from.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I looked close at the belt of the lads&#39; blue
shirts. On the elder&#39;s I read in a woman&#39;s
handwriting, &quot;Martin Luther Macglashin, 6,
&#39;87.&quot; The younger boy&#39;s bore in the same hand
the corresponding inscription, &quot;John Knox Macglashin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
6, &#39;86.&quot; It somehow deepened the
tragedy of the situation to come upon those
simple domestic reminiscences at such a
moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sons of a Scotch missionary, apparently,&quot; I
said, as I read them out. &quot;If only we could
find where their father was at work, we might
manage to get some clue to this mystery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We can look him up,&quot; Jim answered, &quot;when
we get to Fiji.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We rowed back in silence the rest of the way
to the <i>Albatross</i>, lifted the poor boys tenderly
on board, and laid them down to rest on our
own bunks in the cabin. Serang-Palo, our
Malay cook, made haste at the galleys to dress
them a little arrowroot with condensed milk;
and before half an hour the younger boy was
sitting up in Jim&#39;s arms with his eyes and mouth
wide open, craving eagerly for the nice warm
mess we were obliged to dole out to his enfeebled
stomach in sparing spoonfuls, and with
a trifle of color already returning to his pale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
cheeks. He was too ill to speak yet&mdash;his
brother indeed lay even now insensible on the
bunk in the corner&mdash;but as soon as he had finished
the small pittance of arrowroot which
alone we thought it prudent to let him swallow
at present, he mustered up just strength enough
to gasp out a few words of solemn importance
in a very hollow voice. We bent over him to
listen. They were broken words we caught,
half rambling as in delirium, but we heard
them distinctly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steer for Makilolo ... Island of Tanaki
... Wednesday the tenth ... Natives will
murder them ... My mother&mdash;my father&mdash;Calvin&mdash;and
Miriam.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then it was evident he could not say another
word. He sank back on the pillow breathless
and exhausted. The color faded from his cheek
once more as he fell into his place. I poured
another spoonful of brandy down his parched
throat. In three minutes more he was sleeping
peacefully, with long even breath, like one who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
hadn&#39;t slept for nights before on the tossing
ocean.</p>

<p class="indent">I looked at Jim and bit my lips hard. &quot;This
is indeed a fix,&quot; I cried, utterly nonplussed.
&quot;Where on earth, I should like to know, is this
island of Tanaki!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; said Jim. &quot;But wherever it
is, we&#39;ve got to get there.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chIII" id="chIII"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE MYSTERY SOLVED.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">We</span> paused for a while, and looked at
one another&#39;s faces blankly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suppose,&quot; Jim suggested at last, &quot;we get
out the charts and see if such a place as Tanaki
is marked upon them anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right you are,&quot; says I. &quot;Overhaul your
maps, and when found, make a note of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Well, we did overhaul them for an hour at a
stretch, and searched them thoroughly, inch by
inch, Jim taking one sheet of the Admiralty
chart for the South Pacific, and I the other;
but never a name could we find remotely resembling
the sound or look of Tanaki. Tom
Blake, too, was positive, as he put it himself,
that &quot;there weren&#39;t no such name, not in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
whole thunderin&#39; Pacific, nowheres.&quot; So after
long and patient search we gave up the quest,
and determined to wait for further particulars
till the boys had recovered enough to tell us
their strange story.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, it was clear we must steer somewhere.
We couldn&#39;t go beating wildly up and
down the Pacific, on the hunt for a possibly
non-existent Tanaki, allowing the <i>Albatross</i> to
drift at her own sweet will wherever she liked,
pending the boys&#39; restoration to speech and
health. So the question arose what direction
we should steer in. Jim solved that problem as
easy as if it had come out of the first book
of Euclid (he was always a mathematician,
Jim was, while for my part, when I was a little
chap at school, the asses&#39; bridge at an early
stage effectually blocked my further progress.
I could never get over it, even with the
persuasive aid of what Dr. Slasher used politely
to call his <i>vis a tergo</i>.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re too weak to row far, these lads,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
Jim said in his didactic way&mdash;ought to have
been a schoolmaster or a public demonstrator,
Jim: such a head for proving things! &quot;Therefore
they must mostly have been drifting before
the wind ever since they started. Now, wind
for the last fortnight&#39;s been steadily nor&#39;east&quot;&mdash;the
anti-trade was blowing. &quot;Therefore,
they must have come from the nor&#39;east, I take
it; and if we steer clean in the face of the
wind, we&#39;re bound sooner or later to arrive at
Tanaki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jim,&quot; said I, admiring him, like, &quot;you&#39;re
really a wonderful chap. You do put your finger
down so pat on things! Steer to the nor&#39;-east
it is, of course. But I wonder how far off
Tanaki lies, and what chance we&#39;ve got of
reaching there by Wednesday the tenth?&quot; For
though we didn&#39;t even know yet who the people
were who were threatened with massacre at this
supposed Tanaki, we couldn&#39;t let them have
their throats cut in cold blood without at least
an attempt to arrive there in time to prevent it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
Of course, we knew with our one brass gun
we should be more than a match for any
Melanesian islanders we were likely to meet
with, if once we could get there; but the trouble
was, should we reach in time to forestall the
massacre?</p>

<p class="indent">By Wednesday the tenth we must reach
Tanaki&mdash;wherever that might be.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim took out a piece of paper and totted up
a few figures carelessly on the back. &quot;We&#39;ve
plenty of coal,&quot; he said, &quot;and I reckon we can
make nine knots an hour, if it comes to a push,
even against this head wind. To-day&#39;s the
sixth; that gives us four clear days still to the
good. At nine knots, we can do a run of two
hundred and thirty-six knots a day. Four two-hundred-and-thirty-sixes
is nine hundred and
forty-four, isn&#39;t it? Let me see; four sixes is
twenty-four; put down four and carry two: four
three&#39;s is twelve, and two&#39;s fourteen: four two&#39;s&mdash;yes,
that&#39;s all right: nine hundred and forty-four,
you see, ex-actly. Well, then, look here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
Julian: unless Tanaki&#39;s further off than nine
hundred and forty-four nautical miles&mdash;which
isn&#39;t likely&mdash;we ought to get there by twelve
o&#39;clock on Wednesday at latest. Nine hundred
and forty-four miles is an awful long stretch for
two boys to come in an open boat. I don&#39;t
expect these boys can have done as much as
that or anything like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wind and current were with them,&quot; I
objected, &quot;and she was drifting like one o&#39;clock
when we first sighted her. I shouldn&#39;t be surprised
if she was making five or six knots an
hour before half a gale all through that hard
blow. And the poor boys look as if they might
have been out a week or more. Still, it isn&#39;t
likely they would have come nine hundred
knots, as you say, or anything like it. If we
put on all steam, we ought to arrive in time to
save their father and mother. Anyhow we&#39;ll
try it.&quot; And I shouted down the speaking
tube, &quot;Hi, you there, engineer!&mdash;pile on the
coal hard and make her travel. We want all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
the speed we can get out of the <i>Albatross</i> for
the next three days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All square, sir,&quot; says Jenkins; and he piled
on, accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">So we steamed ahead as hard as we could go, in
the direction where we expected to find Tanaki.</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour later, Nassaline, who had been
down below with the Malay cook and one of
the men, looking after the patients, came up on
deck once more, with a broad grin on his jet-black
face from ear to ear, and exclaimed in
his very best Kanaka-English, &quot;Boy come
round again. Eat plenty arrowroot. Eat allee
samee like as if starvee. Call very hard for see
Massa Captain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think&#39;s the matter with them,
Nassaline?&quot; I asked, as I walked along by his
side towards the companion-ladder.</p>

<p class="indent">Nassaline&#39;s ideas were exclusively confined
to a certain fixed and narrow Polynesian circle.
&quot;Tink him fader go sell him for laborer to a
man <i>oui-oui</i>, or make oven hot for him,&quot; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
answered, grinning; &quot;so him run away, and
come put himself aboard Massa Captain ship;
so eat plenty&mdash;no beat, no starvee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was his own personal history put in brief,
and he fitted it at once as the only possible explanation
to these other poor fugitives.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; I said, with a compassionate
smile at his innocence. &quot;White people don&#39;t
sell or eat their children, stupid! It&#39;s my
belief, Nassaline, we&#39;ll never make a civilized
Christian creature of you, in a tall hat, and
with a glass in your eye. You ain&#39;t cut out for
it, somehow. How many times have I explained
to you, boy, that Christians never cook and eat
their enemies?... They only love them,
and blow them up with Gatlings or Armstrongs&mdash;a
purely fraternal method of expressing
slight differences of international opinion....
Now, come along down and let&#39;s see these lads.
It&#39;s some of your heathen relations, I expect,
the poor fellows are flying from.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But I omitted to have remarked to him (as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
might have done) that I hadn&#39;t seen such a
painful sight before, since I saw the inhabitants
of a French village in Lorraine&mdash;old men,
young girls, and mothers with babies pressed
against their breasts&mdash;flying, pell-mell, before
the sudden onslaught of a hundred and fifty
Christian Prussian Uhlans. These little peculiarities
of our advanced civilization are best
not mentioned to the heathen Polynesian.</p>

<p class="indent">In the cabin we found both boys now fairly
on the high-road to recovery, though still, of
course, much too weak to talk; but bursting
over, for all that, with eagerness to tell us their
whole eventful history. For my own part, I,
too, was all eagerness to hear it; but anxiety
for their safety made me restrain my impatience.
The elder boy, now leaning on his elbow and
staring wildly before him with horror&mdash;a mere
skeleton to look at, with his sunken cheeks and
great hollow eyes&mdash;began to break forth upon
me with his long tale in full; but I soon put a
stop to that, you may be pretty sure, with most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
uncompromising promptitude. &quot;My dear Mr.
Martin Luther Macglashin,&quot; I said severely,
giving him the full benefit of all his own various
high-sounding names for greater impressiveness,
&quot;if you don&#39;t lean back this moment upon your
pillow, quiet your rolling eye down to everyday
proportions, and answer only in the shortest
possible words nothing but the plain questions
I put to you, hang me, sir, if I don&#39;t turn you
and John Knox adrift again upon the wild
waves, and continue on my course for Levuka
in Fiji.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, how did you come to know our
names?&quot; he exclaimed, astonished. &quot;You
must be as sharp as a lynx, Captain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s not an answer to my question I
asked you,&quot; I replied with as much sternness as
I could put into my voice, looking at the poor
fellow&#39;s starved white face. &quot;But as a special
favor to a deserving fellow-creature, I don&#39;t
mind telling you. I&#39;m as sharp as a lynx, as
you say, and a trifle sharper: for no lynx
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
would have looked for your names on the flap of
your shirts&mdash;There, that&#39;ll do now; don&#39;t try to
talk; just answer me quietly. Where do you
come from, and where do you want us to go to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Martin lifted up his face and answered with
becoming brevity, &quot;Tanaki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s better!&quot; I said. &quot;That&#39;s the sort
of way a fellow ought to answer, when he&#39;s
more than half-starved with a week at sea. But
the next thing is, where&#39;s Tanaki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s one of the group that used to be called
the Duke of Cumberland&#39;s Islands,&quot; the boy
answered faintly, yet overflowing with eagerness.
&quot;They lie just beyond the Ellice Archipelago,
nearly on the line of a hundred and
eighty, as you go towards the Union Group
along the parallel of&quot;....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, my dear boy,&quot; I said, &quot;if you run on
like that, as I said before, I shall have to turn
you adrift again in your open boat at the mercy
of the ocean. Do be quiet, won&#39;t you, and let
me look up your island?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
&quot;We can&#39;t be quiet,&quot; Master John Knox put
in eagerly, &quot;when we know they&#39;re going to
murder our father and mother and Calvin and
Miriam, on Wednesday morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just you hold your tongue, sir,&quot; I said, pushing
him down again on his bunk, &quot;and wait
till you&#39;re spoken to. Now, not another word,
either of you, till I&#39;ve consulted my chart. Jim,
hand down the Admiralty sheets again, there&#39;s
a good fellow, will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jim handed them down, and we commenced
our scrutiny at once. We soon found the Duke
of Cumberland&#39;s Islands, and as good luck would
have it, found we were steering as straight as an
arrow for them. The direction of the wind had
not misled us. But no such place as Tanaki
could we still find anywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It used to be called &#39;The Long Reef,&#39;&quot;
Martin said, looking up; &quot;but now we call it
by the native name, Tanaki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! The Long Reef,&quot; I said; &quot;why didn&#39;t
you say so at first? I know that well enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
by sight on the chart; but I never heard it
called Tanaki before. That accounts, of course,
for the milk in the cocoa-nut. Jim, hand along
the calipers here, and let&#39;s measure out the
course. Two&mdash;four&mdash;six&mdash;eight,&quot; I went on,
looping along line of sailing with the calipers.
&quot;A trifle short of eight hundred miles. Say
seven hundred and eighty. And we have
till Wednesday morning. Well, we ought to
do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll be in time to save them, then!&quot; the
elder boy cried, jumping up once more like a
Jack-in-the-box. &quot;You&#39;ll be in time to save
them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you be quiet, if you please?&quot; I said,
poking him down again flat, and holding my
hand on his mouth. &quot;O, yes! I expect we&#39;ll
be in time to save them. If only you&#39;ll let us
alone, and not make such a noise. We can do
nine knots an hour easy, under all steam; and
that ought to bring us up to Tanaki, as you call
it, by Wednesday morning in the very small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
hours. Let&#39;s see, we&#39;ve got four clear days to
do it in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Five,&quot; the boy answered. &quot;Five. To-day&#39;s
Friday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no,&quot; I replied curtly. &quot;Will you please
shut up? Especially when you only darken counsel
with many words. You&#39;re out of your reckoning.
To-day&#39;s Saturday, I tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And in point of fact, indeed, it really was
Saturday.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it&#39;s Friday,&quot; Martin went on with extraordinary
persistence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Saturday,&quot; I repeated. &quot;Knife; scissors:
knife; scissors.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we got away from Tanaki eight days
ago,&quot; the boy declared strongly with a very
earnest face; &quot;and it was Thursday when we
left. I kept count of the days and nights all that
awful time we were tossing about on the ocean
alone, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m right. To-day&#39;s Friday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jim,&quot; I said, turning to my brother, &quot;what
day of the week do you make it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
&quot;Why, Saturday, of course,&quot; Jim answered
with confidence.</p>

<p class="indent">I went to the bottom of the companion-ladder
and called out aloud where the boy could hear
me, &quot;Tom Blake, what day of the week and
month is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Saturday the sixth, sir,&quot; Tom called out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, my boy,&quot; I said, turning to him,
&quot;you see you&#39;re mistaken. You&#39;ve lost count
of the time in this awful journey of yours. I
expect you were half unconscious the last day
and night. But, good heavens, Jim, just to
think of what they&#39;ve done! They&#39;ve been out
nine days and nights in an open boat, almost
without food or drink, and they&#39;ve come all
that incredible distance before the high wind.
Except with a ripping good breeze behind them
they could never have done it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For my part,&quot; said Jim, looking up from his
chart, &quot;I can hardly understand how they ever
did it at all. I declare, I call it nothing short
of a miracle!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
And so indeed it was: for it seemed as though
the wind had drifted them straight ahead from
the moment they started in the exact direction
where the <i>Albatross</i> was to meet them.</p>

<p class="indent">I&#39;m an old seafaring hand by this time, and I
may be superstitious, but I see the finger of fate
in such a coincidence as that one.</p>

<h2><a name="chIV" id="chIV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="h3">MARTIN LUTHER&#39;S STORY.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">For</span> the next two days we went steaming
ahead as hard as we could go in a bee-line
to the northeastward, in the direction of the
Duke of Cumberland&#39;s Islands; and it was two
days clear before those unfortunate boys, Jack
and Martin&mdash;for that was what they called one
another for short, in spite of their severely theological
second names&mdash;were in a condition to
tell us exactly what had happened, without
danger to their shattered nerves and impaired
digestions.</p>

<p class="indent">When they did manage to speak&mdash;both at
once, for choice, in their eagerness to get their
story out&mdash;here&#39;s about what their history came
to, as we pieced it together, bit by bit, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
things they told us at different times. If I were
one of those writing chaps, now, that know how
to tell a whole ten years&#39; history, end on end,
exactly as it happened, without missing a detail,
I&#39;d get it all out for you just as Martin told us;
or better still, I&#39;d give it to you in a single connected
piece, between inverted commas, as his
own words, beginning, &quot;I was born,&quot; said he,
&quot;in the city of Edinburgh,&quot; and so forth, after
the regular high-and-dry literary fashion. But
how on earth those clever book-making fellows
can ever remember a whole long speech, word
for word, from beginning to end, I never could
make out and never shall, neither. What memories
they must have to do it, to be sure! It&#39;s
my own belief they make it up more than
half out of their own heads as they go along,
and are perfectly happy if it only just sounds
plausible. But anyhow, Martin Luther Macglashin
didn&#39;t tell us all his story at a single
time, or in a connected way; he gave us a bit
now and a bit again, with additions from Jack,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
according as he was able. So being, as I say,
no more than a free-and-easy master mariner
myself, without skill in literature, I&#39;m not going
to try to repeat it all, word for word, to you precisely
as it came, but shall just take the liberty
of spinning my yarn my own way and letting
you have in short the gist and substance of what
we gradually got out of our two fugitives.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, it seems that Jack and Martin&#39;s father
was, just as I suspected, a Scotch missionary on
the Island of Tanaki. He lived there with another
family of missionaries of the same sect,
in peace and quiet, as well as with an English
merchant of the name of Williams, who traded
with the natives for calico, knives, glass beads
and tobacco. For a long time things had gone
on pretty comfortably in the little settlement;
though to be sure the natives did sometimes
steal Mr. Macglashin&#39;s fowls or threaten to tie
Mr. Williams to a cocoa-nut palm and take cock-shots
at him with a Snider, out of pure lightness
of heart, unless he gave them rum, square gin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
or brandy. Still, in spite of these playful little
eccentricities of the good-humored Kanakas,
who will have their joke, murder or no murder, all
went as merrily as a wedding bell (as they say
in novels) till suddenly one morning a French
labor-vessel&mdash;I suspect the very one we had intercepted
in the act of trying to carry off Nassaline&mdash;put
into the harbor in search of &quot;apprentices.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was a very bad lot, from what the boys
told us; a genuine slaver of the worst type;
and she stirred up a deal of mischief at
Makilolo.</p>

<p class="center">NATIVES OF THE ISLAND OF TANAKI. Page 58</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">On the shore the Chief of Tanaki was drawn
up to receive them with all his warriors, tastefully
but inexpensively rigged out in a string of
blue beads round the neck, an anklet of shells
and a head-dress of a single large yellow feather.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you?&quot; shouts the chief at the top
of his voice. &quot;You man a <i>oui-oui</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; the Frenchman shouts back in his
pigeon-English. &quot;Me de commander of dis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
French ship. Want to buy boys. Must sell
them to us. Tanaki French island. Discovered
by Bougainville.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no,&quot; says the Chief in pigeon-English
again. &quot;Tanaki no belong a man a <i>oui-oui</i>.
Tanaki belong a Queenie England. Capitaney
Cook find him long time back. My father little
fellow then; him see Capitaney, him tell me
often. Capitaney Cook no man a <i>oui-oui</i>; him
fellow English.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other natives joined in at once with their
loud cry, &quot;Chief speak true. Tanaki belong a
Queenie England. Tanaki no belong a man a
<i>oui-oui</i>. If man a <i>oui-oui</i> want to take Tanaki,
man a Tanaki come out and fight him.&quot; And
they threw themselves at once into a threatening
attitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you got any Englishmen here?&quot; the
French skipper called out, to make sure of his
ground.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; says the missionary&mdash;our boys&#39; father&mdash;standing
out from the crowd. &quot;Three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
English families here. Settled on the island.
And we deny that this group belongs to the
French Republic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that the Frenchman pulled back a bit.
When he saw there was likely to be opposition,
and that his proceedings were watched by three
English families, he drew in his horns a little.
He knew if he interfered too openly with the
missionaries&#39; proceedings, an English gunboat
might come along, sooner or later, and overhaul
him for fomenting discord on an island
known to be under the British protectorate.
So he only answered in French, &quot;Well, we&#39;re
peaceable traders, Monsieur. We don&#39;t want to
interfere with the British Government. Consider
us friends. All we desire is to hire laborers.&quot;
And he landed his boat&#39;s crew before the very
face of Macglashin and the Tanaki warriors.</p>

<p class="indent">At first, as often happens in these islands,
the natives were very little disposed to trade
with the strangers in boys or women, for they
were afraid of the Frenchmen; and Macglashin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
and the other missionary did all they knew to
prevent the new comers from carrying off any
of the islanders into practical slavery. But after
awhile the Frenchmen produced their regulation
bottles of square gin (that&#39;s what they call Hollands
in the South Pacific), and began to treat
the Chief and the other savages to drinks all
round, as much as you liked, with nothing to
pay for it. In a very short time the Chief had
got so much liquor aboard that his legs wouldn&#39;t
answer the rudder any longer, and he began to
reel about like a perfect madman. Most of the
other full-grown men natives followed suit before
long, and lay down on the beach half dead with
drunkenness. Perhaps the liquor was drugged;
perhaps it wasn&#39;t; but anyhow, in spite of all the
missionaries could do, the shore before nightfall
was in a condition of the wildest and most bestial
orgies. The men, in what the newspapers call
&quot;a high state of vinous exhilaration,&quot; were ready
to sell their boys and girls, or anything else on
earth for a little more gin; and as the missionaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
were naturally helpless to prevent it, the
Frenchman was soon driving a roaring trade in
flesh and blood against the drunken savages.</p>

<p class="indent">The business-like way they went to work,
Jack and Martin told us, was horribly disgusting.
The women, indeed, they tried to wheedle
and cajole&mdash;&quot;You like go along a New Caledonia
along a me? Only three yam times; then ship
bring you back again. Very good feed; plenty
nyam-nyam. Pay very good. Pay money. Lots
of shop. You buy what you like: you buy red
dress, red handkerchief, beads like-a-chiefie. No
fight; no beat; no swear at you. You good girl;
I good fellow master.&quot; But if they couldn&#39;t induce
them, by fair words and promises and little
presents of cheap French finery, to put their
mark to their sham indentures, then they just
knocked them down with a blow on the head,
dragged them by their hair to the boats hard
by, and got their fathers or husbands to put
their marks, and receive a few dollars and some
red cloth in payment.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
As for the boys, they handled them like
so many animals in a market. &quot;Turn round,
<i>cochon</i>! Show me your faces! <i>Mille tonnerres</i>,
let me see how you can run, you dirty young
blackguard!&quot; They examined them as a veterinary
would examine a horse. &quot;Why, there
was our little fellow, Nangaree,&quot; Jack said to
us with deep concern&mdash;&quot;Nangaree, that used
to clean up things for mother at the mission-house:
his father sold him for twenty dollars.
The captain looked at his legs, and at the
glands in his throat, to see if he&#39;d had the
chicken-pox and the measles. Then he said to
his mate, &#39;This lot&#39;s cheap enough. He&#39;s a first-rate
lad, and can speak English. He&#39;ll do for
the hold. Bundle him along!&#39; And the mate
caught him up by the scruff of his neck and
hauled him to the boats, kicking and screaming;
and that was the last we saw of poor
Nangaree!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For three days and nights, it seems, this
horrible inhuman market or slave-fair went on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
upon the beach, the Frenchmen taking care to
keep the natives well primed with spirits all
the time, till they&#39;d got their hold full, and
were prepared to sail away again with their
living cargo. Then at last they upped anchor,
and out of the harbor. But before they went,
the skipper, it appears, who was angry at the
missionaries for having interfered with him, and
was afraid they might report his proceedings to
the British Government when next the mission
ship came that way on her provisioning rounds,
took aside the Chief in a confidential chat, and
tried to inflame his mind, all mad drunk that he
was, against the English residents. Apparently
he had made so good a three days&#39; work of it
with his horrible trade, and found it so convenient
to draw his supplies from this remote
and almost unvisited island, that he thought it
would be nice if before his next visit he could get
rid altogether of these meddlesome strangers.
He didn&#39;t want European witnesses to crop up
against him in future; so he told the Chief, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
a great show of confidence, that Macglashin and
his friends were not English at all, but Scotch;
and he pointed out that it was uncomfortable
for the natives to be interfered with in their trading
operations by a set of white-livered curs who
objected to the selling of boys and girls into
temporary slavery. Surely a Chief had a right
to do as he would with his own subjects! What
else he said, Heaven knows, but this is what
happened as soon as the French, with their
horrid cargo, had got well clear of the unhappy
island.</p>

<p class="indent">That very afternoon, the Chief, beginning to
get sober again, but quarrelsome from headache
and the other after-effects of a long
debauch, came round to the mission-house in a
towering rage, and asked the unsuspecting
missionary, &quot;Say, white man, are you a
Scotchman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; says Macglashin, not knowing what
was coming. &quot;I&#39;m a Scotchman, Chief, certainly.
I was born in Scotland.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
The Chief laughed loud. &quot;Ha, ha,&quot; he said,
&quot;then Queenie England no take care a you.
No send gunboat to shoot us all dead, if man a
Tanaki come up and kill you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that Macglashin grew alarmed, and
answered, &quot;O, yes! The Queen of England
would certainly avenge us.&quot; And he tried to
explain the exact relation in which Scotchmen
stood to the British crown&mdash;that they were
just as much British subjects as Englishmen,
entitled to precisely the same amount of protection.
But the Chief couldn&#39;t be made to understand.
The French skipper had evidently
poisoned his mind against them. &quot;Man a
Tanaki don&#39;t want no Scotchman interfere with
Chief when him go to sell him boy and him
woman,&quot; the savage said angrily. &quot;Tanaki
belong a Queenie England. Queenie England
no want Scotchman interfere with people in
Tanaki. Scotchman better keep quiet in him
house. Queenie England no mind Scotchman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
And no amount of reasoning produced any
effect upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">The missionaries went to bed that evening
with many misgivings. They felt that for the
first time, so far as the natives were concerned,
the powerful protection of the British flag was
now practically withdrawn. They were alone,
as strangers, among those excited black fellows.</p>

<p class="indent">At dead of night, while the two boys slept,
a horrible din outside the mission-house awoke
them. They looked out, and saw the red glare
of torches outside. A frightful horde of Kanakas,
naked save for their war-paint, drunk with
the Frenchman&#39;s rum and armed with his Sniders,
surrounded the frail building in a hideous
mob of savagery. As Martin put his head out
of the lattice a bullet came whizzing past. He
withdrew it for a moment, terrified, and then
looked out again. As he did so the other
Scotch missionary appeared upon the veranda,
half-dressed, and holding up his hand in dignified
remonstrance, began in Kanaka with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
gentle mild voice, &quot;My friends, my dear friends,
...&quot; Before he could get any further, the
Chief stepped forward, and aiming a blow at
his gray locks with a sacred native tomahawk,
felled the peaceful old teacher senseless to the
ground. Martin shuddered with horror. The
old man lay weltering in a pool of his red gushing
gore, while the savages danced in triumph
over his prostrate body, or smeared themselves
with great lines and circles of his warm heart-blood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on!&quot; the Chief cried in Kanaka.
&quot;Kill all! Kill every one! They&#39;re taboo to
our gods. Don&#39;t fear their gunboats. Queenie
England won&#39;t trouble to protect a Scotchman!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then began a hideous orgy of wild lust and
slaughter. The savages rushed on, drunk with
blood and rum, and dragged out the wife and
children of the other missionary, whom they
brained upon the spot, before the terrified eyes
of the trembling Macglashins. The trader
Williams ran up just then, with his revolver in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
his hand, followed by two faithful black servants
from a neighboring island; but the
French skipper had been cunning enough there
too. &quot;Him a Welshman!&quot; the savages cried.
&quot;Queenie England no care for him!&quot; For
indeed he happened to be born in Wales. And
they shot him down as he came, before he could
open fire upon them. Then they turned to
massacre the Macglashins, the only remaining
Europeans on the island.</p>

<p class="indent">But just at that moment a sudden idea
seemed to strike the Chief. He cried out,
&quot;Stop!&quot; The savages fell back and listened
with eagerness to what was coming. Then the
Chief shouted out again in Kanaka&mdash;&quot;I have
a thought. The gods have sent it to me. This
is my thought. We have killed enough for tonight.
Let us catch them alive and bind them.
Next moon is the great feast of my father
Taranaka. I have an idea&mdash;a divine idea. Let
us keep them till that day, and then, in honor of
the gods, let us roast them and eat them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
The whole assembly answered with a wild
shout of delighted assent&mdash;&quot;Taranaka! Taranaka!
Our great dead Chief! In honor of
Taranaka, let us roast them and eat them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So they rushed wildly on upon the defenseless
white family, bound them in rude cords of
native make, and carried them off in triumph to
Taranaka&#39;s temple tomb in the palm-grove.</p>

<p class="indent">And that was as much as we could allow the
boys to tell us at a time, of their strange adventures.
We were afraid of overtaxing their
strength at first, and tried to confine their attention
as much as possible to tinned meats and
sea-biscuit soaked in condensed milk; though
I&#39;m bound to admit that as soon as they began
to recover appetite a bit, they addressed themselves
steadily and seriously to their food, with
true British pluck and perseverance. In spite
of the terrors from which they had just escaped,
they did the fullest justice to Serang-Palo&#39;s
cookery.</p>

<h2><a name="chV" id="chV"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="h3">A BREAK-DOWN.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Time</span> went on, and the boys began to grow
visibly fatter. It was Tuesday evening,
and we hoped, putting on all steam as we were
doing, to reach Tanaki by the small hours of
Wednesday morning, in good season to relieve
the four unhappy souls still, as we believed,
detained there in captivity. We were strained
on the very rack of excitement, indeed, with our
efforts to arrive before the savages could take
any further step; and the boys&#39; anxiety for their
parents&#39; and their sister&#39;s safety had naturally
communicated itself to us, as we listened to
their story. Why, it was that very evening that
Martin had told us the rest of his strange tale&mdash;how
his father and mother, with his younger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
brother Calvin and his sister Miriam, had been
confined by the savages in the grass-hut temple,
while he and Jack were put to lie in an open
out-house hard by, guarded only by a single
half-intoxicated Kanaka. Well, in the middle
of the night, those two brave boys had silently
gnawed their ropes asunder, and creeping past
their guard had stolen away to the beach in the
desperate effort to escape in search of assistance.
There, they luckily found the mission boat
hauled down on the shore; and waiting only to
take a can of water from the spring close by,
and a bunch of half-ripe bananas from a garden
on the harbor, they had put forth alone on their
wild and adventurous voyage across the lone
Pacific. I can tell you, it brought the tears to
our eyes more than once, rough sailors as we
were, to hear the strange story of their hopeless
sail, and it made our blood boil to learn
how these ungrateful savages had repaid the
earnest and devoted life-labor of the unhappy
missionaries.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
&quot;No wonder him hungry,&quot; that young monkey
Nassaline said, with profound condolence, &quot;if
him don&#39;t hab nuffin to eat for ten day long but
unripe banana.&quot; Anything that concerned the
human stomach always touched a most tender
and responsive chord in Nassaline&#39;s sympathies.</p>

<p class="indent">At eight bells when my watch was up, I went
off for a quiet snooze to my cabin. I knew I
should be wanted for hot work about three in
the morning, for I didn&#39;t expect to effect the
rescue without a hard fight for it; so I thought
it best to get what sleep I could before arriving
at the islands. So I lay in my berth, with my
eyes shut, and a thin sheet spread over me (for
it was broiling hot tropical weather), and I was
just beginning to doze off in comfort, when suddenly
I felt something move under me like a
young earthquake. Next minute I was jolted
clean out of my bed, with such a jerk that I
thought at first we were all going to sleep on
the bed of the ocean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Halloo,&quot; I cried out to Jim up atop, rushing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
out of my cabin. &quot;What&#39;s up? Anything
wrong? What&#39;s happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grazed a reef, I guess,&quot; Jim shouted back,
calmly. &quot;No land in sight, but shoal water
and breakers ahead. We seem to be in danger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cool chap, Jim, under no matter what circumstances.
But this looked serious. In a second
I was up, and peering out over the bows into
the dark black water. The <i>Albatross</i> had
slowed, and was reversing engines. All round
us we could see great heaving breakers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No land hereabouts,&quot; Jim sung out, consulting
the chart once more. &quot;We ought to be
at least five miles to suth&#39;ard of the Great
Caycos Band Reef.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke, I saw Martin&#39;s white face
appearing suddenly at the top of the companion-ladder.
He flung up his hands in an agony of
despair. &quot;Oh, how terrible!&quot; the poor lad
blurted out in his misery. &quot;I ought to have
remembered! I ought to have told you!
Father says the charts hereabouts are all many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
miles wrong in their bearings. The Caycos Reef
lies six or seven knots south by west of the
point it&#39;s marked at!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a ferment of anxiety I turned up our other
Sydney charts at once to test his statement.
Sure enough there was a discrepancy, a considerable
discrepancy, both in latitude and
longitude, between the two maps. At the margin
of one I read this vague and uncomfortable
note&mdash;&quot;These islands are reported by certain
navigators to lie further south and west than
here laid down, and have never been accurately
surveyed by good authorities. Careful navigation
by day alone is recommended to master
mariners.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jim looked at me, and I looked at Jim.
What on earth could we do in such a fix as this?
To go on in the dark, with unknown reefs before
us, was to imperil the <i>Albatross</i> and all on
board; to cast anchor where we stood and hold
back till daylight was to risk not arriving in
time to rescue the unfortunate missionary with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
his wife and family. I glanced at the boy&#39;s
white face as he stood by the companion-ladder,
and made up my mind at once. Come what
might, I must push forward and save them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Slow engines,&quot; I called down the pipe,
&quot;and proceed half-speed till further orders.
Jim, go for&#39;ard, and keep a sharp eye on the
breakers. As soon as we&#39;re clear, we&#39;ll steam
ahead full pelt again, and risk going ashore
sooner than leave these poor folks on the island
to be cruelly massacred.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; the boy said, with an ashy
face, and lay down upon the deck, unmanned
and trembling. His lips were as white, I give
you my word, as this sheet of paper I&#39;m this
moment writing upon.</p>

<p class="indent">For a hundred yards or so we slowed, and
went ahead without coming to any further stop;
then suddenly, a sharp thud&mdash;a dull sound of
grating&mdash;a thrill through the ship; and Jim,
looking up from in front, with a cool face as
usual, called out at the top of his voice, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
with considerable annoyance, &quot;By Jove, we&#39;re
aground again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And so we were, this time with a vengeance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back her,&quot; I called out, &quot;back her hard,
Jenkins!&quot; and they backed her as hard as the
engines could spurt; but nothing came of it.
We were jammed on the reef about as tight as
a ship could stick, and no power on earth could
ever have got us off till the tide rose again.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, we tried our very hardest, reversing
engines first, and then putting them forward
again to see if we could run through it by main
force; but it was all in vain. Aground we were,
and aground we must remain till there was
depth of water enough on the reef to float us.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately the tide was rising fast, and three
hours more would see us out of our difficulties.
Three hours was a very serious delay; but I
calculated if we got off the reef by two in the
morning, we should still have time to reach
Tanaki pretty comfortably before seven. We
must enter the harbor by daylight, no doubt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
which would perhaps be dangerous; because
when the savages saw us arrive, they might
make haste to cut the white people&#39;s throats
before we could get up to rescue them. But I
thought it more likely they would try to save
them, to prevent our opening fire upon them by
way of punishment; so with what comfort we
could, we stuck on upon the reef, and waited
for the inevitable tide to come and float us.</p>

<p class="indent">Waiting for the tide is always slow business.</p>

<p class="indent">At about half-past one, however, the water
began to deepen under the ship, and we could
feel her rise and fall&mdash;bump, bump, bump&mdash;with
each onslaught of the breakers. Now
bumping on a reef isn&#39;t exactly wholesome for
a ship&#39;s bottom, so I gave the word to Jenkins
for the engines to go to work again; and presently,
after two or three unsuccessful attempts,
we got her safe off, by energetic reversing, and
found to our great delight that the <i>Albatross</i>,
like a tight little craft that she was, had sprung
no leak, and was making no water. Her sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
old timbers had just grazed the surface of that
flat-topped reef without suffering any serious
internal injury.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as we were free, and had examined
our hold, I shouted down once more, &quot;Now
forward, boys, as hard as you can go, and mind,
Jenkins, you make her travel!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To my immense surprise, instead of obeying
my orders, the <i>Albatross</i> suddenly stood stock-still
in the trough of a wave, drifting helplessly
about like a log on the ocean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now then,&quot; I shouted down again, half angry
and half alarmed. &quot;What are you doing there,
Jenkins? Didn&#39;t you hear what I said? Stir your
stumps, my friend! Double time, and forward!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Imagine my horror when the engineer shouted
back in a voice of blank dismay, &quot;I can&#39;t, sir.
She won&#39;t work. Don&#39;t answer to the valve.
We&#39;ve injured something in backing her off the
reef there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was an awkward job. And at such a
crisis, too! In a minute I was down in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
engine-room myself, inspecting all the valves
and bearings with lamp in hand, and with the
closest scrutiny. Before long we had ascertained
the extent of the injury. A piece of the
engine was broken that would certainly take us
six or eight hours to repair. And it was already
two o&#39;clock on the Wednesday morning!</p>

<p class="indent">But that wasn&#39;t all, either. Another serious
difficulty beset us in our work. We were beating
about in the angry sea off the Caycos Reef,
with the breakers dashing in, and the surf
running high. If we tried to mend the broken
engine where we stood, we should infallibly be
dashed to pieces on the dangerous shallows.
You can&#39;t go to work like that on a lee shore,
with no engine to fall back upon, and the wind
blowing half a gale. The only thing possible
for us was to hoist sail and make for the open
sea to southward under all canvas. That was
taking us further away from Tanaki, of course;
but it was our one chance of getting our engine
repaired in peace and quiet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
So we hoisted sail and stood out to sea once
more, leaving the dim long line of surf gradually
behind us on the lee, and beating by constant
tacks against the wind, which had now veered
to the southeast, and was blowing us straight
on to the Caycos shallows.</p>

<p class="indent">By four o&#39;clock we&#39;d got so far out that we
thought we might lie to a bit and take a few
hands off navigating duty to assist the engineer
in repairing his engine.</p>

<p class="indent">But it proved a much more difficult and
lengthy task to retrieve the mischief than we
had at first sight at all anticipated. The minutes
went by with appalling rapidity. Five
o&#39;clock came, and the smith was only just
getting his iron well hammered into shape.
Six o&#39;clock, and the engineer was still fitting
the place it came from. Seven o&#39;clock&mdash;something
wrong, surely, with the ship&#39;s time! Before
this hour I had hoped to be anchored off
the harbor of Tanaki.</p>

<p class="indent">Seven o&#39;clock on Wednesday morning; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
by twelve at noon, so the boys assured us, the
ovens would be made hot at Taranaka&#39;s tomb for
those unfortunate prisoners on the remote
island!</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, how frantically we worked for the next
two hours! and how remorselessly everything
seemed to turn against us! How is it that
whenever one&#39;s in the greatest hurry all nature
seems to conspire to defeat one&#39;s purpose? I
won&#39;t attempt to explain to you all the petty
mishaps and unfortunate failures that attended
our efforts. It seemed as if iron, wood, and
coal&mdash;all inanimate matter itself&mdash;was banded
together to make our further approach to
Tanaki impossible. By nine o&#39;clock I knew the
worst myself. The breakdown to the engine was
far more serious than we had at first imagined.
I felt sure that before noon at earliest, with all
our skill and toil, we couldn&#39;t possibly repair it.</p>

<p class="indent">But I shrank from telling those two poor
trembling lads that there was no hope now left
of saving their parents.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Gradually, however, as the day wore on, they
discovered it themselves&mdash;they saw that the
golden opportunity had been lost for us. As
each hour passed by they told us with ever redoubled
horror what they knew must at that
moment be passing on the island. Now the
savages would be bringing their father out before
the prison hut, and sacrificing him with
their tomahawks by the hideous blood-stained
altar of their great dead chieftain. Now their
poor mother would be crouching on the ground,
trying in vain to protect their helpless little
brother. Now Miriam herself, little golden-haired,
three-year-old, innocent Miriam&mdash;but
at that last horror they broke down in tears, and
could say no more. They could only sob and
hide their faces in their hands with speechless
agony at that unspeakable picture.</p>

<p class="indent">By noon we knew the worst must be over.
They were at rest now, poor souls, from their
month-long misery. The afternoon dragged on
and we still worked hard on the mere chance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
of some respite which might enable us to rescue
them. But we felt sure the end had come for
all that. We worked away by the mere force of
pure aimless energy. It distracted us from thinking
of the awful events which we nevertheless in
our hearts felt certain must have happened.</p>

<p class="indent">It was eight at night before we got the
<i>Albatross</i> fairly under way again; and even
then she lumbered slowly, slowly on, the engine
being only somehow repaired, in the most
clumsy fashion, till we could reach harbor once
more, and quietly overhaul her.</p>

<p class="indent">So we steamed ahead, feebly and cautiously,
all night long, keeping a sharp lookout for land
across our bows, and with Martin on deck almost
all the time, to aid us by his close personal
knowledge of the island approaches.</p>

<p class="indent">Wednesday the tenth was over now. The
terrible day had come and gone. We didn&#39;t
doubt that the massacre was completed long
before the clock struck one on Thursday
morning.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chVI" id="chVI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="h3">ON THE ISLAND.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">At</span> Tanaki meanwhile, as we afterwards
learned by inquiry among the islanders,
things had been going on with the unhappy
missionary very much as our worst fears had
led us to expect. Though I wasn&#39;t there at
the time to see for myself, I got to know what
happened a little later almost as well as if I&#39;d
been on the spot; so I shall take the liberty
once more&mdash;not being one of these book-making
chaps&mdash;of telling my story my own way,
and explaining how matters went in rough sailor
fashion, without trying to let you know in detail
how we found it all out till I come to explain
the upshot of our present adventures.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, on the night when Martin and Jack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
stole away from the hut and got clear off on
their venturesome journey in the mission boat,
their father and mother, with little Calvin, who
was eight years old, and Miriam, who was a
pretty wee lassie of three, were heavily guarded
by half a dozen desperate and drunken savages
in the temple-tomb of the deceased Taranaka.
It was a thatched native grass-house, with a bare
mud floor, and a rough altar-slab raised high on
the threshold, which covered the remains of the
blood-thirsty old chieftain&mdash;the man who in his
early youth had seen &quot;Capitaney Cook&quot; when
he discovered the islands. The Melanesian
natives, I ought to tell you, regard their dead
ancestors as a sort of gods or guardian spirits,
and frequently offer up food and drink at their
graves as presents to appease them. Every
morning gifts of taro, bread-fruit, and plantain
were laid on the altar by Taranaka&#39;s tomb; and
once every ten days a little square gin, mixed
with cocoa-milk, was poured out upon the rude
slab of unsculptured stone, that the dead chief&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
ghost might come to drink of it and be satisfied.
Wednesday the tenth was the anniversary of
Taranaka&#39;s death (he had been killed in a fight
with some neighboring islanders, who fell out
with him over the wreck of an American whaling
vessel), and it was on that festival day that
the chief proposed offering up the blood of our
fellow-countrymen as an expiation to the shades
of his departed relative.</p>

<p class="indent">Macglashin and his wife never even knew that
the boys had escaped. If they had, those long
days of suspense might have been even worse for
them. They might have been looking forward
with mad hope to some miracle of rescue such
as that which the <i>Albatross</i> had so boldly planned,
and which had been so cruelly interfered
with by the breakdown of our machinery. As
it was, the savages carefully kept from them all
knowledge of their boys&#39; escape. They never
even breathed a hint of that desperate voyage.
Every day, on the contrary, when they brought
the unhappy missionary and his wife their daily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
rations of yam and banana, they taunted them
with threats of what tortures the Chief had
still in store for Jack and Martin. They were
fatting them up, they said, for Taranaka to
feed upon. On Taranaka&#39;s day they would be
offered up as victims on the cannibal altar.</p>

<p class="indent">But the most terrible part of all the poor
father and mother&#39;s sufferings was the fact that
they couldn&#39;t keep the knowledge of that awful
fate in store for them even from Calvin and
pretty little Miriam. Macglashin&#39;s diary, which
I read later on, was just heartrending about
the children. Those helpless mites cowered all
day long on the bare mud floor of that hideous
temple, awaiting the horrible doom that the
savages held out before them with the painful
resignation of innocent childhood. They were
too frightened to cry over it; too frightened to
talk of it; they only crouched pale and terrified
by their mother&#39;s side, and dragged out the
long day in horrible apprehensions. They
knew they must die, and they sat there watching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
for that inevitable sentence to be carried out
with the stoical fortitude of utter childish helplessness.
Well, there&mdash;I&#39;m an old hand on
the sea, you know, and I don&#39;t mind the dangers
of the wind and waves for grown men and
boys that can look after themselves, any more
than most of you land-folks mind dodging about
in the Strand at Charing Cross on a crowded
afternoon in the London season; but I can&#39;t
bear to talk or even to think of what those
poor children suffered all those terrible days in
the heathen tomb-house. There are things
that make a man&#39;s blood run cold to speak
about. That makes mine run cold: I can&#39;t
dwell on it any longer; it&#39;s too ghastly to
realize.</p>

<p class="indent">So there&mdash;the days went by, one after another;
and Monday the eighth came, and Tuesday the
ninth, and still no chance of escape or rescue.
Up to the last moment, Macglashin hoped (as
he says in the diary) that some miracle might
occur to set them free, some interposition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
Providence on their behalf to prevent the last
misfortune from overtaking his poor pallid little
Miriam. Perhaps the mission ship, that went
her rounds twice a year, might happen to put
in, out of due season, with some special message
or under stress of weather; or perhaps
some whaling vessel or some English gunboat
might arrive in the nick of time in the little
harbor of Tanaki. But when Tuesday evening
came, and no help had arrived, the unhappy
man&#39;s heart sank within him. He gave up that
last wild hope of a rescue at the eleventh hour,
and addressed himself to die with what courage
he could muster.</p>

<p class="indent">Ah yes, to die one&#39;s self is all easy enough;
nobody worth his salt minds that; but to see
one&#39;s wife and children murdered before one&#39;s
eyes&mdash;there, I&#39;m a rough sort of sailor-body,
as I said before, but you must excuse my breaking
off. I haven&#39;t got the strength to hold my
pen and write about it. Why, I&#39;ve a boy of
my own at school at Sydney, and my Mary&#39;s in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
England, bless her little heart! at a lady&#39;s college
they call it nowadays; and I know what it
means; I know what it means, gentlemen. I&#39;d
no more expose those two dear children in the
places I&#39;ve been among the islands myself, than&mdash;well,
than I&#39;d send them to sea alone in a cock-boat.
And my heart just bleeds for that poor
father at Tanaki, when I read his diary over
again, though I haven&#39;t got the skill to put it
all down in words at full length as one of those
fellows would do that write for the newspapers.</p>

<p class="indent">However, on Tuesday night, neither Macglashin
himself nor Mrs. Macglashin could get
a wink of sleep, as you may easily imagine.
They sat up in the temple, with their backs
against the wall, and relays of black fellows,
armed with Sniders, and smeared with red paint,
watching them closely all the while, to see they
didn&#39;t escape or try to do away with themselves.
But Calvin fell asleep out of pure fatigue on
his mother&#39;s lap, and Miriam, poor little soul,
lay against her father&#39;s shoulder, dozing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
peacefully as ever she dozed in her own small
cot at the mission-house, where she was born.
Once the thought came into her father&#39;s mind,
oughtn&#39;t he to twist his handkerchief round her
soft little throat, as she lay there all unconscious
in his circling arms, to save her from the tender
mercies of those cruel black savages? How
could he tell what torments they might inflict
upon her? Wasn&#39;t it better she should be
spared all that horror of fear? Wasn&#39;t it better
she should just sleep away her dear little
life without ever knowing it, till she woke next
morning in a happier and a brighter country?
But in another minute his heart recoiled from
the terrible thought. While there was still one
chance of safety he must let things take their
course. Perhaps even those black monsters
might have pity at the last on that one ewe
lamb. Perhaps they might spare his Miriam&#39;s
life, and make her over to the mission-ship when
it next arrived on its rounds at the island.</p>

<p class="indent">All that night long the savages, for their part,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
were holding a <i>sing-sing</i>, as they call it, close by,
and the hideous noise of their heathenish
revels could be distinctly heard by the watchers
in the temple. They danced to the music of
their hollow drums, while the shells upon their
ankles resounded in unison. At times the echo
of horrible laughter fell harsh upon the ear.
The natives, covered with red feathers and
smeared with blood, were keeping high festival,
as is their horrid custom. And as the long
hours wore away, the din of their revelry became
more wild in their orgies each moment.</p>

<p class="indent">Morning dawned at last&mdash;the morning of
Wednesday the tenth, when that awful deed of
bloodshed was to be done before the open eye
of heaven; and with the first streak of light the
poor children awoke and gazed around them
blankly at their temple prison. The black
watchers brought them yam and mammee-apples
once more, but they couldn&#39;t eat; they
sat bewildered and mute, with their hands
clasped in their parents&#39; palms, waiting for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
end, and too dazed and terrified almost to know
what was passing.</p>

<p class="indent">About six o&#39;clock the Chief came down to
the temple, with bloodshot eyes and tottering
feet, attended by half a dozen naked black followers.
They had all been drinking the greater
part of the night at the <i>sing-sing</i>, for the Frenchmen
had left plenty of square gin behind; and
they rollicked in the cruel good-humor of the
born savage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do, Macglashin?&quot; the Chief inquired
with a hateful leer. &quot;How do, white woman?
Taranaka day come at last. How you like him
this morning? What for you no tell man a
Tanaki sooner you don&#39;t know Englishman?
Ha! ha! dat true; so him see. Queenie England
no care for Scotchman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you dare to touch a hair of our heads,&quot;
Macglashin cried in his despair, rising up and
facing the savage angrily, &quot;sooner or later, I tell
you, the Queen of England will hear of it, and
she&#39;ll send a gunboat to punish you for our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
death, and her sailors&#39;ll shoot you all down for
your part in this murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Chief laughed&mdash;a wild, horrible, barbaric
laugh. &quot;Ha! ha!&quot; he answered. &quot;Dat
all very fine for try frighten me. But man a
<i>oui-oui</i> tell me you no true Englishman. You
speakee English, but you Scotchman born. All
samee American. Queenie England no care for
American, no care for Scotch; no send her gunboat
for look after Scotchman. Man a Tanaki
go for eat you to-day, for do honor to ghost a
Taranaka.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Macglashin saw that words would produce no
effect upon the tipsy and excited wretch; he
must make up his mind for the worst. There
was no help for it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At least,&quot; he cried, &quot;Chief, you&#39;ll let us
say good-by to our boys before we die? You&#39;ll
bring them in for their mother and me to take
our last farewell of them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Chief shook his head and made a hideous
grimace. &quot;No say good-by to boys,&quot; he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
with horrible glee. &quot;Man a Tanaki kill pig all
night; kill Scotchman in morning. Kill baby
first; then boy; then mother. Last of all, kill
you yourself, Macglashin. Taranaka very much
love white man&#39;s blood. Great day to-day for
feast for Taranaka.&quot; And he went off again, grinning
in hideous buffoonery, while Macglashin&#39;s
soul seethed in speechless indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">For half an hour more they were left undisturbed.
Then the Chief appeared at the door
once more, and beckoning with his long black
forefinger, called to the missionary&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come out, Macglashin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The unhappy man strode out with little
Miriam half-fainting in his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come out, white woman!&quot; the savage cried
once more.</p>

<p class="indent">The pale mother, almost unable to totter with
terror, made her way to the door, with Calvin&#39;s
fingers intertwined in her own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, white people, we going to shoot you,&quot;
the savage continued, unabashed. &quot;You make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
too much trouble for man a Tanaki. Interfere
too much with man who sell him boy or him
woman. Me don&#39;t going to kill you with axe,
like Taranaka kill first missionary that come a
Tanaki. Man a <i>oui-oui</i> sell me plenty Snider.
Man a Tanaki want to try him shooting-irons.
Set you up to run, and then go fire at you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the word he nodded, and four stalwart
savages caught Macglashin in their arms and
held him to a line drawn lightly in the dust by
the Chief&#39;s stick. At the same moment four
others caught his unhappy wife, and dragged
her, half senseless, to the self-same line. The
two children were ranged by their sides, pale
and white with terror. Then the Chief walked
forward, and drew another line some forty
yards in front of them with his stick again.
&quot;When Chief call &#39;go,&#39;&quot; he called out, &quot;man a
Tanaki let go missionary, and boy, and white
woman. Missionary run till him reach dis line.
Man a Tanaki no shoot till missionary pass dis
line. Den man a Tanaki fire; missionary run;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
man a Tanaki run after missionary to kill him.
Whoever shoot missionary or white woman first,
give him body up in temple to Taranaka.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke, the savages ranged themselves
behind, Sniders in hand. The Chief placed
himself in order at their head on the right.
Then he called out in Kanaka, &quot;When I give
the word&mdash;&#39;one, two, three&#39;&mdash;loose them!
When I give the word Fire! off with your rifles
at them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a deadly pause. All was still as
death. Then the Chief cried aloud, &quot;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;loose
them!&quot; and the savages
loosed the poor terrified Europeans.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in that supreme moment of agony and
doubt, however, one thought kept rising ever in
the father&#39;s and mother&#39;s heart. What had
become of Jack and Martin?</p>

<h2><a name="chVII" id="chVII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="h3">ERRORS EXCEPTED.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was Thursday the eleventh, in the small
hours of the morning. The <i>Albatross</i> was
lumbering along as best she might with her
broken engine, and we were nearing the line of
180°. We weren&#39;t making much way, however,
for the speed was low; and we hadn&#39;t so much
reason for hurrying now, for we felt almost
hopeless of being in time to prevent the threatened
massacre. Our people, we feared, had
long since fallen victims to the superstition and
bloodthirstiness of the ungrateful savages.</p>

<p class="indent">I was asleep in my berth after the fatigues of
the day, and was dreaming of my dear little
girl in England; when suddenly I felt a clammy
cold hand laid upon my own outside the coverlet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
and waking with a start, I saw Martin
Luther standing pale and white in his blue
shirt and trousers before me. I knew at once
by his face something fresh had turned up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goodness gracious, boy,&quot; I exclaimed,
&quot;what on earth&#39;s the matter now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Captain Braithwaite,&quot; he answered with
very solemn seriousness, &quot;I&#39;ve been counting
the days over and over again, and I&#39;m quite sure
there&#39;s a mistake somewhere. We&#39;ve got a day
wrong in our reckoning, I&#39;m certain. I&#39;ve
counted up each day and night a hundred times
over since we left Tanaki in the boat&mdash;Jack
and I&mdash;and I feel confident you&#39;re twenty-four
hours out in your reckoning. Yesterday wasn&#39;t
Wednesday the tenth at all. It was Tuesday the
ninth, and we may yet reach Tanaki in time to
save them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, my boy,&quot; I answered, &quot;you&#39;re
wrong; you&#39;re wrong. Your natural anxiety
about your father&#39;s fate has upset your calculations.
To-day&#39;s the eleventh; yesterday was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
tenth. Till we get to the meridian of 180°&quot;&mdash;and
then, with a start, I broke off suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Martin cried, for he
saw at once I was faltering and hesitating.
&quot;Ah, you see I was right now. You see this
morning&#39;s the tenth, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a moment the truth flashed across me with
a burst. I saw it all; the only wonder was how
on earth I had failed so long to perceive it. I
seized the poor lad&#39;s hand in a fervor of delight,
relief and exultation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Martin,&quot; I cried, overjoyed, &quot;we are both
of us right in our own way of reckoning. This
morning&#39;s the eleventh on board the <i>Albatross</i>
here, but it&#39;s the tenth, I don&#39;t doubt, in your
island at Tanaki!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he cried, astonished,
and gazing at me as if he thought me rather
more than half-mad. &quot;How on earth can it be
Thursday here, while it&#39;s Wednesday at Tanaki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold on a bit, youngster,&quot; said I, jumping
out of my cabin, &quot;till I&#39;ve consulted the chart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
and made quite sure about it. Let me see.
Here we are. Duke of Cumberland&#39;s Islands,
179° west. Hooray! Hooray!&quot; I waved the
chart round my head in triumph. &quot;Jim, Jim!&quot;
I shouted out, rushing up the companion-ladder
in my night-shirt as I stood; &quot;here&#39;s a hope
indeed! Here&#39;s splendid news. Put on all
steam at once and we may save them yet.
Tanaki&#39;s the other side of 180!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jim looked at me in astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, what on earth do you mean, Julian?&quot;
he asked. &quot;What on earth has that to do with
our chance of saving them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jim,&quot; I cried once more, hardly knowing
how to contain myself with excitement and reaction;
&quot;was there ever such a precious pair of
fools in the world before as you and me, my
good fellow? It&#39;s Wednesday morning in
Tanaki, man! It&#39;s Wednesday in Tanaki!
Tanaki&#39;s the other side of 180!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As I said the words, Jim jumped at me like a
wild creature and grasped my hand hard. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
he caught Martin in his arms and hugged him as
tight as if he&#39;d been his own father. After that
he threw his cap up in the air and shouted aloud
with delight. And when he&#39;d quite finished all
those remarkable performances, he looked hard
into my face and burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, upon my soul, Julian,&quot; he said, &quot;for
a couple of seasoned old Pacific travelers, I
do agree with you that a pair of bigger fools
and stupider dolts than you and I never sailed
the ocean!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it had been our first voyage across now,&quot;
I said to Jim, feeling thoroughly ashamed of
myself for my silly mistake, &quot;there might have
been some excuse for us!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or if the boy hadn&#39;t told us there was a
discrepancy in the accounts the very first day
he ever came aboard,&quot; he added solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But as it is,&quot; I went on, &quot;such a scholar&#39;s
mate, such a beginner&#39;s blunder as this is for
two seafaring men&mdash;why, it&#39;s absolutely inexcusable!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
&quot;Absolutely inexcusable!&quot; Jim repeated,
penitently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if we clap on all steam we may get there
yet on Wednesday morning,&quot; I continued, consulting
my watch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By three or four o&#39;clock on Wednesday morning,&quot;
Jim echoed, examining the chart once
more, and carefully noting the ship&#39;s position.
&quot;Why, it&#39;s Wednesday now, Julian. We&#39;ve
crossed 180°.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what day was yesterday?&quot; Martin asked,
all trembling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yesterday,&quot; I answered, &quot;was Wednesday
the tenth, my boy; but to-day is Wednesday
the tenth also. It comes twice over at this
longitude. We&#39;ve gained a day; that&#39;s the long
and the short of it. We ought to have known
it, my brother and I, who are such old hands
at cruising in and out of the islands; but our
anxiety and distress made us clean forget it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How does that come about?&quot; Martin asked
bewildered, his lips white as death.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
&quot;Just like this,&quot; said I. &quot;Sailing one way,
you see, from England, you sail with the sun;
and sailing the other way, you sail against
it. In one direction you keep gaining time, and
in the other you lose it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The meridian of 180° is the particular place
where the two modes of reckoning reach their
climax,&quot; I hastened to add. &quot;So, when you
get to 180°, sailing west, you lose a day, and
Saturday&#39;s followed right off by Monday. But
sailing east, you gain a day, and have two Sundays
running, or whatever else the day may be
when you happen to get there. Now, we&#39;re
going in the right direction for gaining a day;
and so, though yesterday was Wednesday the
tenth the other side of 180°, to-day&#39;s Wednesday
the tenth, don&#39;t you see, this side of it? And
as Tanaki&#39;s this side, your people must always
have reckoned by the American day, so to speak,
while we&#39;ve reckoned all along by the Australian
one. It&#39;s this morning those savages threatened
to kill your father and mother, and if we make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
a good run, we shall still perhaps be in time to
save them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As I spoke, the boy&#39;s knees trembled under
him with excitement. He staggered so that he
caught at a rope for support. He was too much
in earnest to cry, but the tears stood still in his
eyes without falling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! I hope to Heaven we&#39;ll be in time,&quot; he
answered. &quot;We may save them! We may save
them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I went below and turned in once more for a
little sleep, for I knew I should be wanted later
in the morning; and having fortunately the true
sailor&#39;s habit in that matter of dozing off whenever
occasion occurred, I was soon snoring away
again most comfortably on my pillow. At half-past
three, Tom Blake came down once more to
wake me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Land in sight, sir,&quot; he said, &quot;on our starboard
bow, and this young fellow Martin says he makes
it out to be the north point of Tanaki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a minute I was on deck again, and peering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
at the dim land through the gray mist of morning&mdash;the
same gray mist through which, as we
afterwards learned, the poor creatures in the
heathen temple saw the dawn break of the day
that was to end their earthly troubles. It was
Tanaki, no doubt, for Martin was quite sure he
could recognize the headlands and the barrier
reef. Our only question now was how next to
proceed. We held a brief little council of war
on deck, with Martin as our chief adviser on
the local situation.</p>

<p class="indent">From what he told us, I came rapidly to the
conclusion that it would be useless to attempt an
open entrance into the little harbor of Makilolo,
where the Chief had his hut, and where the mission-people,
as we believed, were still confined
in the temple. To do so would only be to arouse
the anger of the savages beforehand; and unless
we could get them well between a cross fire, and
so effectually prevent any further outrage, we
feared they might massacre the unhappy people
in their hands the moment we hove in sight to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
enter the harbor. But here our friend Martin&#39;s
local knowledge of the archipelago helped us
out of our difficulty. He could pilot us, he
said, to a retired bay at the back of the island,
by the east side, where we could land a small
party in boats, well armed with Sniders and our
Winchester repeater; and Jack, who had slept
all night, and was therefore the fresher of the
two, would show us a path through the thick
tropical underbrush by which we could approach
the village from the rear, while the <i>Albatross</i>
ran round again with the remainder of the crew,
and brought our brass thirty-pounder to bear
upon the savages from the open harbor.</p>

<p class="indent">This plan was at once received with universal
approbation, and we proceeded forthwith to put
it into execution.</p>

<p class="indent">Steering cautiously round the island, under
cover of the mist, and fortunately unperceived
by the assembled natives, who were too much
occupied with their <i>sing-sing</i> to be engaged in
scanning the offing, we reached at last the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
retired bay of which Martin had spoken, and
got ready our boat to land our military party.
It was ticklish work, for we could afford to
land only ten, all told, with Jack for our guide;
but each man was armed with a good rifle and
ammunition, and the habit of discipline made
our little band, we believed, more than a match
for those untutored savages. Nassaline, also,
joined the military party, while seven men were
left as a naval reserve. Silently and cautiously
we landed on the white sandy beach, and turned
with Jack into the thick tangled brake of tropical
brushwood.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, my brother Jim, with Martin to
guide him, undertook to take the <i>Albatross</i> round
to the regular harbor; for Martin fortunately
knew every twist and turn of those tortuous
reef-channels, having been accustomed to navigate
them from his childhood upwards, both
in the mission-boat and in the native canoes
which frequently put to sea for the <i>bêche-de-mer</i>
fishery.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
Our plan of action, as arranged beforehand,
was for the military party to wait about in the
woods at the back of the village till the <i>Albatross</i>
hove in sight off the mouth of the harbor. Then,
the moment she appeared, she was to fire a
blank shot towards the Chief&#39;s hut with her
thirty-pounder; and at the same moment, we of
the surprise party were to fall upon the savages,
and before they could recover from their first
surprise, demand the instant restitution of the
missionary and his family.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything depended now upon the two boys.
If Jack failed to show us the path aright&mdash;if
Martin drove the <i>Albatross</i> upon reef or rock&mdash;all
would be up with us, and the savages would
massacre our whole party in cold blood, as they
proposed to do with Macglashin and his little
ones. I trembled to think on how slender a
thread those four precious human lives depended.
After all, they were but lads, mere children
almost, and the rash confidence of youth might
easily deceive them. But I decided, none the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
less, to trust to their instincts and their keen
affection for their friends to see us through in
our need. If that wouldn&#39;t lead us right, I felt
sure in my own soul no human aid could possibly
save the unhappy prisoners.</p>

<h2><a name="chVIII" id="chVIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">HOT WORK.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jack</span> led us from the beach over the white
coral sand straight up to the wood, and
after looking about for a while to make sure
of his bearings among the huge fallen logs,
hit at last upon a faint trail that led straggling
through the forest&mdash;a trail scarcely worn into
the semblance of a path by the bare feet of
naked savages. Following his guidance, we
plunged at once, with some doubtful misgivings,
into the deep gloom of the woodland, and found
ourselves immediately in a genuine equatorial
thicket, where mouldering trunks of palms encumbered
the vague path, and great rope-like
lianas hung down in loops from the trees overhead,
to block our way at every second step
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
through that fatiguing underbrush. The day
was warm, even as we travelers who know the
world judge warmth in the tropical South
Pacific; and the moist heat of that basking,
swampy lowland, all laden with miasma from
the decaying leaves, seemed to oppress us with
its deadly effluvia and its enervating softness
at every yard we went through the jungle.
Moreover, we had to carry our arms and ammunition
among that tangled brake; and as our
rifles kept catching continually in the creepers
that drooped in festoons from the branches,
while our feet got simultaneously entangled in
the roots and trailing stems that straggled underfoot,
you can easily imagine for yourself
that ours was indeed no pleasant journey. However,
we persevered with dogged English perseverance;
the sailors tramped on and wiped
their foreheads with their sleeves from time to
time; while poor Jack marched bravely at our
head with an indomitable pluck which reflected
the highest credit on Mr. Macglashin&#39;s training.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
The only one who seemed to make light of
the toil was our black boy, Nassaline.</p>

<p class="indent">We went single file, of course, along the
narrow trail, which every here and there divided
to right or left in the midst of the brake with
most puzzling complexity. At every such
division or fork in the track, Jack halted for a
moment and cast his eye dubiously to one side
and the other, at last selecting the trail that
seemed best to him. Nassaline, too, helped us
not a little by his savage instinct for finding his
way through trackless jungle. For my own
part, I could never have believed any road on
earth could possibly be so tortuous; and at
last, at the end of the twenty-fifth turn or thereabouts,
I ventured to say in a very low voice
(for we were stealing along in dead silence),
&quot;Why, Jack, I believe you&#39;re leading us round
and round in a circle, and you&#39;ll bring us out
again in the end at the very same bay where
we first landed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush!&quot; Jack answered, with one finger on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
his lip. &quot;We&#39;re drawing near the outskirts of
the village now. You must be very quiet. I
can just see the grass roof of Taranaka&#39;s temple
peeping above the brushwood to the right. In
three minutes more we shall be out in the
open.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And sure enough he told the truth. Almost
as he ceased speaking, the noise of savage
voices fell full upon my ear from the village in
front, and I could hear the natives, in their
hideous corroboree, beating hard upon their
hollow drums of stretched skin, and shouting
in the dance to their drunken comrades.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a ghastly noise, but it did our hearts
good just then to hear it.</p>

<p class="indent">I could almost have clapped my hand upon
Jack&#39;s back and given him three cheers for his
gallant guidance when we saw the village plot
opening up in front of us, and the naked savages,
in their war-paint and feathers, guarding
the door of Taranaka&#39;s temple. But the necessity
for caution compelled me to preserve a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
solemn silence. So we crouched as still as
mice behind a clumpy thicket of close-leaved
tiro bushes, and peeped out from our ambush
through the dense foliage to keep an eye upon
the scene till the <i>Albatross</i> hove into sight in
the harbor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father and my mother must still be
there,&quot; Jack whispered under his breath, but
in a deep tone of relief. &quot;The Tanaki men
are guarding them exactly as they did when
Martin and I left the island. I almost think I
can see Miriam&#39;s head through the open door.
We shall be in time still to deliver them from
these bloodthirsty wretches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In what direction must we look for the
<i>Albatross</i>?&quot; I whispered back. &quot;Will she
come in from the south there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O, no!&quot; Jack answered in a very low voice.
&quot;That&#39;s an island to the right&mdash;a little rocky
island that guards the harbor. There&#39;s deep
water close in by the shore that side. Martin
&#39;ll try to bring her in the northern way, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
the natives mayn&#39;t see her till she&#39;s close upon
the village. It&#39;s a difficult channel to the north,
all full of reefs and sunken rocks; but I think
he understands it, he&#39;s swam in it so often.
We won&#39;t see her at all till she&#39;s right in the
harbor and just opposite the temple.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We were dying of thirst now, and longing for
drink, but could get nothing to quench our
drought. &quot;What I would give,&quot; I muttered to
Tom Blake, &quot;for a drink of water!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Captain want water,&quot; Nassaline answered,
&quot;me soon get him some.&quot; And he made a gash
with his knife in the stem of a sort of gourd
that climbed over the bushes, from which there
slowly oozed and trickled out a sort of gummy
juice that relieved to some degree our oppressive
sensations. All the men began at once
cutting and chewing it, with considerable satisfaction.
It wasn&#39;t as good as a glass of British
beer, I will freely admit; but still, it was better
than nothing, any way.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time it was nearly half-past six, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
we watched eagerly to see what action the
natives would take as soon as they finished
their night-long <i>sing-sing</i>. Lying flat on the
ground, with our rifles ready at hand, and our
heads just raised to look out among the foliage,
we kept observing their movements cautiously
through the thick brushwood.</p>

<p class="indent">At a quarter to seven we saw some bustle
and commotion setting in on a sudden in front
of the temple; and presently a tall and sinister-looking
native, who, Jack whispered to me, was
the Chief of Tanaki, came up from the village,
where the <i>sing-sing</i> had taken place, and stood by
the door of the thatched grass-house. We could
distinctly hear him call the missionary to come
out in pigeon English; and next moment our unfortunate
countryman staggered forth, with his
little daughter half fainting in his arms, and
stood out in the bare space between the tomb of
Taranaka and the spot where we were lying.</p>

<p class="indent">Oh! how I longed to take a shot at that
miscreant black fellow.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
At sight of his father, worn with fatigue and
pale with the terror of that agonizing moment,
Jack almost cried aloud in his mingled joy and
apprehension; but I clapped my hand on his
mouth and kept him still for the moment. &quot;Not
a sound, my boy, not a sound,&quot; I whispered low,
&quot;till the time comes for firing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we give it them hot now?&quot; Tom Blake
inquired low at my ear next moment. But I
waved him aside cautiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not yet,&quot; I answered, &quot;unless the worst
comes to the worst, and we see our people in
pressing and immediate danger; we&#39;d better
do nothing till the <i>Albatross</i> heaves in sight.
Her gun will frighten them. To fire now would
be to expose ourselves and our friends there to
unnecessary danger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, sir,&quot; Tom murmured low in reply.
&quot;You know best, of course. But I must say,
it&#39;d do my &#39;eart good to up an&#39; pepper &#39;em!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come out, white woman!&quot; we heard the
Chief say next with insolent familiarity; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
Mrs. Macglashin stepped out, a deplorable figure,
with her boy&#39;s hand twined in hers, and
her white lips twitching with horror for her
little ones. It made one&#39;s blood boil so to see
it that we could hardly resist the temptation as
we looked to fire at all hazards, and let them
know good friends were even now close at hand
to help and deliver them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whether the <i>Albatross</i> heaves in sight or
not,&quot; I whispered to Tom Blake, &quot;we must fire
at them soon&mdash;within five minutes&mdash;and sell
our lives as dearly as we can. I can&#39;t stand
this much longer. It&#39;s too terrible a strain.
Come what may, I must give the word and at
them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right, sir,&quot; says Tom. &quot;What&#39;s the
use of delaying?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And, indeed, I began to be terribly afraid by
this time there was something very wrong indeed
somewhere. Could Martin have missed
his way among those difficult shoals, and run
our trusty vessel helplessly on the rocks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
reefs? It looked very like it. They were certainly
overdue; for even at the present crippled
rate of speed, the good old <i>Albatross</i> had had
plenty of time, I judged, to round the point and
get back safe again into the deep water of the
harbor. If she failed in this our hour of need,
the natives would surround us and cut us to
pieces in a mass, for our best reliance was in
our solid brass thirty-pounder. I began to
tremble in my shoes for some time for the possible
upshot. Over and over again I glanced
eagerly towards the point for that longed-for
white nose of hers to appear round the corner.</p>

<p class="indent">At last, unable to restrain my curiosity any
longer, I rose to my feet and peered across the
bushes. As I did so, I saw the savages seize
Macglashin in their arms, and range the four
poor fugitives in a line together. My blood
curdled. The Chief and the ten savages with
the Sniders stood in a row, half fronting us
where we lay. Macglashin and his wife were
fortunately out of line of fire for our rifles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
&quot;Now, we can delay no longer,&quot; I cried. &quot;He
means murder. The moment the black fellow
gives the word of command, fire at once upon
him and his men, boys. Take steady aim. No
matter what comes. Let the poor souls have a
run for their lives, any way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As I spoke, the Chief uttered in Kanaka the
native words for &quot;One, two, three,&quot; with loud
drunken laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">At the sound of the Chief&#39;s voice, the savages
loosed the four wretched Europeans. At the
very same sound we all fired simultaneously&mdash;and
six of the black monsters fell writhing on
the ground, while the Chief and the four others,
taken completely by surprise, dropped their rifles
in their supreme astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forward, boys, and secure them!&quot; I cried,
dashing out into the open, and waving my hat
to the astounded missionary. &quot;Here we are, sir.
Run this way! We&#39;re friends. We&#39;ve come to
your rescue. Catch the Chief at once, lads;
and hooray for the <i>Albatross!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
For just as I spoke, to my joy and relief, her
good white nose showed at last round the point;
and next instant, the boom! boom! of her jolly
brass thirty-pounder, fired in the very nick of
time, completed the discomfiture of the astonished
savages.</p>

<p class="indent">Before they knew where they were, they found
themselves hemmed in between a raking cross-fire
from our Sniders on one side, and the heavy
gun of the <i>Albatross</i> on the other. The tables
were now completely turned. We charged at
them, running. Macglashin, seizing the situation
at a glance, caught up one of the rifles
belonging to the wounded men, which had
been flung upon the ground, and, hardly yet
realizing his miraculous escape, joined our little
party as an armed recruit with surprising alacrity.
For the next ten minutes there was a
terrible scene of noise and confusion. The
blacks advanced upon us, swarming up from
the village like bees or wasps, and it was only
by a hand-to-hand fight with our bayonets&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
we had fortunately brought them in case of
close quarters&mdash;that we kept our dusky enemy
at bay. At last, however, after a smart hand-to-hand
contest, we secured the Chief, and tied
him safely with the rope he had loosed from
Macglashin. Then we seized the remaining
Sniders that lay upon the ground, while the
men of the village, drunk and stupefied, began
to fall back a little and molest us from a
distance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, put the lady and children in the center,
boys,&quot; I cried, at the top of my voice, &quot;and
let the Chief march along with us as a hostage.
Down to the shore, while the <i>Albatross</i> boat
puts out to save us!&quot; Then I turned to the
savages, and called out in English, &quot;If any one
of you dares to fire at us, I give you fair warning,
we shoot your Chief! Hold off there, all
of you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To my great delight, Nassaline, standing forward
as I spoke, translated my words to them
into their own tongue, and waving them back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
with his hands made a little alley for us through
the midst to regain the shore by. Smart boy,
Nassaline!</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment, however, the natives once
more began to crowd round us, as we started to
march, in very threatening attitudes, with their
Sniders and hatchets. At one time I almost
thought they would overpower us; but just then
Jim, who was watching the proceedings with
his glass from the deck of the <i>Albatross</i>, and
saw exactly how matters stood, created a judicious
diversion at the exact right moment by
firing a little grape-shot plump into the heart
of the grass huts of the village, and bowling
over a roof or two before the very eyes of the
astonished savages. They fell back at once,
and began to make signs of desiring a parley.
So we halted on the spot, with the lady and
children still carefully guarded, and held up
our handkerchiefs in sign of truce. Then Nassaline,
aided by our sailor who understood the
Kanaka language, began to palaver with them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
He told them in plain and simple terms we
must first be allowed to take the lady and children
in safety to the <i>Albatross</i>, and that we
would afterwards come back to treat at greater
length with their head men as to the Chief&#39;s
safety. To this, after some demur, the black
fellows assented; and we beckoned to Jim accordingly
by a preconcerted sign to send the
boat ashore to us, to fetch off the fugitives.
At the same time we retreated in military order,
in a small hollow square, to the beach, still
taking good care to protect in the midst our
terrified non-combatants.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the Chief, he marched before us, with
his hands tied, and his feet free, led by a rope,
the ends of which I held myself, with the aid of
two of my sailors. A more ridiculously crestfallen
or disappointed creature than that drunken
and conquered savage at that particular moment
it has never yet been my fate to light upon.</p>

<p class="indent">We reached the beach in safety, and sent
Mrs. Macglashin and the children aboard, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
Jack to accompany them. Then we turned to
parley with the discomfited savages. Jim kept
the thirty-pounder well pointed in their direction,
with ostentatious precision, and we made
them hold off along the beach at a convenient
distance, where he could rake them in security,
while we ourselves retained the Chief in our
hands, with a pistol at his head, as a gentle
reminder that we meant to stand no nonsense.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few minutes&#39; parley, conducted chiefly
by our Kanaka-speaking sailor, with an occasional
explanation put in by our assistant-interpreter,
Nassaline, we arrived at an understanding,
in accordance with which we were to return
them their Chief for the time being, on
consideration of their bringing us down to the
beach all the Macglashins&#39; goods, and making
restitution for the sack of the mission-house in
dried cocoa-nut, the sole wealth of the island.
Those were the terms for the immediate present,
as a mere personal matter: for the rest,
we gave the Chief clearly to understand that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
we intended to sail straight away with all our
guests for Fiji, there to lay our complaint of
his conduct before the British High Commissioner
in the South Pacific. We would then
charge him with murder and attempted cannibalism,
and with stirring up his people to massacre
the other missionary, and the trader Freeman.
We would endeavor to get a gunboat
sent to the spot, to make official inquiry into
the nature of the disturbances, and to demand
satisfaction on the part of the relations of the
murdered men. Finally, we would also lay before
the Commissioner the conduct of the French
labor-vessel, and her kidnaping skipper, who
had instigated the savages to their dastardly
attack, and whom I was strongly inclined to
identify with the captain from whose grip we
had rescued our friend Nassaline. We gave
the Chief to understand, therefore, that he must
by no means consider himself as scot free,
merely because we let him go unhurt till trial
could be instituted by the proper authorities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
He must answer hereafter for his high crimes and
misdemeanors to the Queen&#39;s representative.</p>

<p class="indent">To all of which the penitent savage merely
answered with a sigh:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me make mistake. Kill missionary by accident.
Man a <i>oui-oui</i> tell me Queenie England
no care for Scotchman, an&#39; me too much believe
him. Now Captain tell me Queenie send gunboat
for eat me up, and kill all my people. No
listen any more to man a <i>oui-oui</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then we put off in triumph to the <i>Albatross</i>.
The family meeting that ensued on
board when Macglashin stood once more upon
a British deck with his wife and children, I
won&#39;t attempt&mdash;rough sailor as I am&mdash;to describe:
I don&#39;t believe even the special correspondent
of a morning paper could do full justice
to it. To see those two lads, too, catch
their pretty little sister once more in their arms,
and cover her with kisses, while she clung to
their necks and cried and laughed alternately,
was a sight to do a man&#39;s heart good for another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
twelvemonth. And as we sat that same
evening round the cabin-table (where our Malay
cook had performed wonders of culinary art for
the occasion), and drank healths all round to
everybody concerned in this remarkable rescue,
the toast that was received with the profoundest
acclamations from every soul on board, was
that of the two brave boys whose courage and
skill had guided us at last, as if by a miracle,
to the recovery of all that was nearest and
dearest to them.</p>

<p class="indent">Indeed, if Martin and Jack don&#39;t get the
Victoria Cross when we return to England, I
shall have even a lower opinion than ever before
of her Majesty&#39;s confidential political advisers
of all creeds or parties.</p>
